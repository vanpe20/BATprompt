Open Letter Opposing British Copyright Indoctrination in Educational Institutions The British Department for Education and Skills (DfES) has recently initiated a "Music Manifesto" campaign, which claims to aim at educating the forthcoming generation of British musicians. Regrettably, they have also partnered with the music industry (EMI and various artists) to promote this initiative. EMI seems to have successfully negotiated terms such that students in our schools will now receive indoctrination regarding the illegality of downloading music. The ignorance and arrogance of this situation prompted me to compose an open letter to the DfES about the matter. Unfortunately, itâ€™s somewhat pedantic, as one might expect when addressing government officials. However, I hope you find it informative, and perhaps feel motivated to take similar action if or when such an issue arises in your locality.	Tech
