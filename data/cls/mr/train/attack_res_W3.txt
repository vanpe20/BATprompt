painful to watch, yet but some viewers who are willing to take a small chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances.	positive
Noyce films it more as a shocking and informative historical history lesson than as a dramatic drama.	positive

an intelligent, thought-provoking, deeply moving, inspiring and invigorating film.	positive
just too silly and overly sophomoric to clearly effectively ensnare its intended target audience.	negative
moore's impressive performance impresses almost as much as her truly remarkable work with haynes in 1995's safe film.	positive
leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion overall.	negative
[taymor] vividly utilizes the powerful and evocative idea of making kahlo's art a living, breathing part of the movie, often catapulting the artist into her own remarkable work. this isn't a new idea. it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion.	positive
Spiderman really rocks a lot in the city.	positive

formulaic to the 51st power, more like a common example, indeed.	negative
it's a brave and bold attempt to tap into the vibrant heartbeat of the modern world, a sincere salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of unique sounds.	positive
impeccably filmed, sexually charged, but ultimately lacking in overall substantial depth, not to mention also dragged down by a leaden closing act.	negative
there's enough truly fascinating science to make it count as genuinely educational, and enough stunning natural beauty to make it utterly unforgettable.	positive
the boys' sparring matches, like the brutal succession of blows dumped on guei, wears down the story's more cerebral, and likable, plot elements.	negative

it never fails to consistently engage us every time.	positive
Woody Allen has really found his creative artistic groove these days. The problem is that it is one unique artistic endeavor that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another.	negative
occasionally funny and consistently odd, and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for talented zhao.	positive
At its best early on as it cleverly plays with the complex culture clashes between the two brothers.	positive
not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen. this isn't really my favorite in the series, still i enjoyed it enough to recommend it overall.	positive
a tired, unimaginative, and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre of popular commercial literature.	negative

the movie slides downhill as soon as the macho action conventions assert themselves clearly.	negative
this is an ungainly movie, somewhat ill-fitting, awkwardly with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be, indeed.	negative
an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and, worse, that you have to pay if you want to see it as well, sadly.	negative
The bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the past decades when it was geared more specifically to adult grownups.	positive
