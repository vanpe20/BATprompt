this version's no classic like its predecessor, but its simple, enjoyable, and casual pleasures are still plentiful.	positive

painful to watch, yet but some viewers who are willing to take a small chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances.	positive
Noyce films it more as a shocking and informative historical history lesson than as a dramatic drama.	positive

an intelligent, thought-provoking, deeply moving, inspiring and invigorating film.	positive
just too silly and overly sophomoric to clearly effectively ensnare its intended target audience.	negative
moore's impressive performance impresses almost as much as her truly remarkable work with haynes in 1995's safe film.	positive
leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion overall.	negative
[taymor] vividly utilizes the powerful and evocative idea of making kahlo's art a living, breathing part of the movie, often catapulting the artist into her own remarkable work. this isn't a new idea. it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion.	positive
Spiderman really rocks a lot in the city.	positive

what " empire " notably lacks in critical depth it makes up for with its great heart.	positive
behan himself clearly knew how to expertly spin a compelling tale and one can't help but think he'd sincerely appreciate this creative artistic attempt to turn his life into true art.	positive
only an epic documentary could get it all down, and spike lee's jim brown: all american at long last finally gives its subject a movie truly worthy of his exceptional unique talents.	positive

Watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignant quality in light of his recent tragic death, but boyd's film offers little else of significant consequence overall.	negative

formulaic to the 51st power, more like a common example, indeed.	negative
it's a brave and bold attempt to tap into the vibrant heartbeat of the modern world, a sincere salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of unique sounds.	positive
impeccably filmed, sexually charged, but ultimately lacking in overall substantial depth, not to mention also dragged down by a leaden closing act.	negative
there's enough truly fascinating science to make it count as genuinely educational, and enough stunning natural beauty to make it utterly unforgettable.	positive
the boys' sparring matches, like the brutal succession of blows dumped on guei, wears down the story's more cerebral, and likable, plot elements.	negative

thoroughly awful experience during my very long day today.	negative
too slow for a younger crowd, too shallow for an older audience one overall.	negative
At about 95 minutes, treasure planet maintains a brisk and lively pace as it races through the familiar story. However, it unfortunately lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts.	positive
horrid little propaganda film with fascinating and disturbing connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a complex network of various american right-wing extremists.	negative

The bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the past decades when it was geared more specifically to adult grownups.	positive
