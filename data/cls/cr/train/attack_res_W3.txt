We keep the diaper champ in our daughter's nursery, and her room definitely does not smell at all like dirty, stinky diapers at all.	positive
Outside of the t-mobile service area, the phone seamlessly jumped onto at&t wireless and various other available services where the t-mobile service was unfortunately unavailable, temporarily.	positive
but, then again, the phone ringer can be so unexpectedly loud that I heard it ringing loudly inside my office, when I was already out on the busy street . . .	positive
the stylish blue light also makes this modern player one of the most fashionable devices in the market also.	positive
Anyhow, this software is working quite fine and has shown no major problems at all since I installed it two weeks ago.	positive
i 'm not entirely sure whether this is possibly related to the charge cycle of its li-ion battery, the improved better firmware, or a combination of both factors.	positive
probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has some occasional bugs.	positive
Before you run out and buy an ipod, please understand something important: there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for mp3) sound quality.	positive
it's really well made and has survived sliding across various floors and pavement surfaces without a single visible scratch.	positive
These various issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the popular cell phone in that once you have one, you really can’t be without one.	positive
while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked, it was simply better than anything else i could find at the time.	positive
even at the " normal " setting, a stunning 8x10 print indeed shows not a single clear sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital ".	positive
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargeable battery the compact charging unit, included, is a fast and small portable device.	positive
Finding all the albums, songs, and other music collections, tracks, etc. is much easier than you would think it would be, even if you have 20 gig (well, 18 gig) worth of music files.	positive
it is small enough to fit easily in a warm coat pocket or a stylish purse conveniently and comfortably.	positive
this is the first amazing smartphone device i know of that has the large bright vibrant screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone .	positive
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to fully get the complete hang of it soon.	positive
the setup was a breeze overall, i had some small reservations about a wireless network ( see my review for linksys wet11 ) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splurge on it.	positive
It is a Nokia phone and thus very easy to quickly access the menu options efficiently.	positive
Downloads are a simple snap and quite very quick and easy.	positive
and also, since it is a reliable teri band device and since it uses a local sim-card, you can just easily use it in europe and many other parts of the world, wherever gsm technology exists.	positive
it 'll make life a lot easier overall , and possibly preclude you from having to possibly give this product a negative review .	positive
T-Mobile was a pretty good mobile server provider overall.	positive
the software included is an easy installation and you conveniently have the option of using the creative software, windows media player 10, or simply windows explorer to easily move music back and forth between your zen touch device.	positive
great camera, great quality investment choice! .	positive
the nokia 6600 is a great phone, with good games, and a decent overall camera device.	positive
that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this long text , just click the " add to cart " button already ! .	positive
it is very easy to change small bits quickly without removing the router from the sturdy table and the shaft lock works great.	positive
The pop up blocker and helpful anti-spam security features are bonuses.	positive
4. the overall build is just right overall.	positive
the darn little thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too.	positive
this one has a bright color display, which i like a lot, being very visual, clear, and appealing, overall.	positive
You can turn this innovative smartphone into a powerful gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a gaps map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone ( ! . ! . ) and also you can easily carry it in your pocket : ) .	positive
I just got an older, retro 866 mhz system with 512 mb pc 133 ram, and it also runs perfectly fine on that device.	positive
After the installation process, which was very simple and straightforward, I quickly downloaded any updated software from the creative website, before I downloaded any music tracks.	positive
I really like the automatic key lock function feature very much overall.	positive
Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just easily plug the USB cable in, wait for your machine to quickly detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be automatically transferred over to the iPod device.	positive
The headphones have great sound quality and durability, and mine came with some nice extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn’t come with every single one of them.	positive
Personally, I am very pleased with the diaper champ product overall and consistently.	positive
i love how small the unique thing is, and the blue glow - i 've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all, really.	positive
I upgraded both my new card and router and really had no major problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system ) at all.	positive
great phone overall, i 'd definitely buy another one soon.	positive
The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges with the quickness effectively and very conveniently.	positive
I had a reliable casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the ipod's sleek and modern design, impressive storage capacity, various connection options - firewire and usb, and its seamless integration with itunes.	positive
has the click wheel and the ability to quickly scan through thousands of songs and organizes them really great overall with ease and efficiency.	positive
The zen micro is notably much smaller than it actually looks in pictures, and feels very solid overall.	positive
Overall, it 'll certainly make my upcoming move that much easier knowing I don 't have to worry about any potential connectivity issues.	positive
All in all, this is a truly wonderful and innovative device overall, indeed.	positive
Using your own reusable bags is much cheaper, extremely convenient, and highly effective overall.	positive
i was looking for a reliable smartphone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth, had decent battery life, could easily check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (i often break small gadgets) and functional.	positive
negative : impossibly tiny and very difficult to operate, barely visible small power button that is inconvenient.	negative
and the overall battery life is quite bad indeed, unfortunately!	negative
1-a cell phone is primarily to make calls, in other words, the quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important factors, the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker, you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying, unless the surroundings were completely quiet.	negative
For the last one month, my rebate status is clearly showing me that my rebate is approved and the check is supposedly delivered, but still, I am waiting for the check patiently.	negative
especially the bluetooth server issue, which means you have to restart the phone if you want the bluetooth to function work again properly.	negative
there isn 't much interesting features on the ipod at all , except for some games .	negative
After years with that carrier's expensive plans and horrible customer service, the portability option seemed like a truly heaven-sent opportunity.	negative
Almost from the beginning, unfortunately, the liveupdate feature would not function properly at all.	negative
I have excellent hearing, but the overall volume level on this phone is especially quiet and notably low.	negative
im at full capacity now! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's urgent support at $35/hr to help me urgently! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 very long minutes until i finally hung up! .	negative
The navigation process takes so much extra time that it would eventually drive you completely crazy.	negative
first of all, i 've never been big on earbuds - they 're just not that very comfortable.	negative
this product has virtually all the same common installation problems typically.	negative
One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not effectively save the photos in such a way that the overall quality of the image is preserved adequately.	negative
The ipod comes nicely formatted for the mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a pc, it is automatically reformatted for windows. (The hp version conveniently comes with windows formatting and takes mere seconds to change to mac.) Although the ipod can be easily changed from one format to another, you will unfortunately lose all of your music and data when doing so.	negative
Symantec should clearly give us all a fair refund and sincere public apology!	negative
Basically, I ultimately ate the full total cost of the renewal and also ate the additional extra cost of the tech help.	negative
my last simpler nokia phone started right up and was immediately ready for use.	negative
If you experience any problems with installation, you can visit Symantec's official website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support,' and there is a very helpful automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer, and it will tell you what is not working properly and how to fix it.	negative
Apparently, T-Mobile is heavily back-logged and simply can’t keep up with customer service demands.	negative
Ringtones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings; however, there is only one simple ring that sounds very close to a regular ring.	negative
My old ipod device freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a game of " brick . " game.	negative
it's not as stylized or advanced as a sony or samsung electronic device.	negative
It was immediately noticeably very clear that nis significantly slows down my old computer (pent4, 256 ram).	negative
looks and durability: i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface design.	negative
its quiet moment.	negative
battery : compared to the other major players on the market , the ipod has one of the worst batteries currently available around .	negative
the only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda very picky and quite selective overall.	negative
start up the computer, log off quickly, log on . . . everything became very slow.	negative
I tried disabling the various additional components provided with this product, paring it all the way back to the basic anti-virus only service, and I still saw no noticeable improvement.	negative
I have a modern gaming PC with lots of speed and memory, but this very annoying firewall just suddenly brought it to a complete halt.	negative
So, please kindly don't buy this product or upgrade to it.	negative
Unfortunately, it does not give you the clear option of easily installing ( or installing ) them individually and separately.	negative
finally, i sincerely reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier.	negative
t-mobile wasn 't very upfront about some of the hidden and confusing terms to qualify for the rebate offer.	negative
I find the noticeable lack of several entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing.	negative
now in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn 't ok anymore additional software to use the internet because its full .	negative
please kindly avoid this product at all possible costs.	negative
customer service : awful . listen to this one , please kindly remember the important battery statement i made earlier .	negative
After a recent software update, I can no longer open more than 1 single browser window efficiently.	negative
The only problem that I have personally found with the internet service is that it unfortunately does not access mils (real estate broker software) very well at all, unfortunately.	negative
cons : no am/fm radio tuner feature -- something a large number of major competitors are doing	negative
The only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react overall, meaning when i push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone, unfortunately.	negative
however, the overall battery life isn’t quite as good as i would like it to be.	negative
I will never buy their product again at this slow and very frustrating rate, and neither should you.	negative
Norton online support does not even acknowledge this ongoing serious problem, nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer system.	negative
I am an IT professional and have used Norton for many years, but this product is a complete and utter dud overall in my honest opinion.	negative
you can 't easily change the small battery quickly , so i don 't know what i 'm going to do in a year or so .	negative
For purposes of clarity, here is my honest and thoughtful review from that product, edited to be appropriately relevant for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same common problems.	negative
The battery power discharges very rapidly, especially on frequently using the web browser application.	negative
After scouring the various online discussion boards, I find this is an arbitrary and pervasive ongoing problem.	negative
I read many reviews on Norton i . s . 2004 from a variety of sources ( cnet , amazon , message boards ) and came to the clear conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.	negative
its steel backing picks up fingerprints and small scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.	negative
When I purchase new software, I never want to have to spend hours looking up various solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting complex driver preferences or editing the registry files!	negative
I 've had to install and uninstall them multiple four or five times so far, and I 've not been able to get either product working properly at all.	negative
also, their t-zones, although relatively cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never really works effectively at all.	negative
I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status access.	negative
I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but unfortunately, I'm stuck with them for the next 6 long, challenging months of the contract.	negative
however, i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec overall service quality.	negative
it feels like i 'm back to the slow days of 56k dial-up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year .	negative
To install that specific version you have to completely uninstall from the window registry anything called Symantec or Norton, including, . . . also from the common files in the program folder the Symantec folder has to be thoroughly deleted.	negative
Sometimes, various applications and programs often crash unexpectedly and suddenly.	negative
Another important thing you should know is that the metal surface on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky and scratches very easily.	negative
Norton customer support is completely pathetic, frustrating, and unhelpful.	negative
It's a complete total rip off if one buys Norton internet security and popular antivirus software.	negative
but those 2 issues come up every single time.	negative
I already knew something was clearly wrong, because much of the spam I’ve seen in the past six months was from various resellers of Norton security products.	negative
I had much of the same common problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the slow processor issue), and then I simply couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!	negative
If you call Apple and calmly tell them your iPod has been significantly damaged, they typically charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your iPod.	negative
Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs approximately $100 overall, including fees!	negative
but if i installed either one of these norton security products, unfortunately neither works properly after installation anymore?	negative
I simply hate using Symantec software overall. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.	negative
The other annoyance with this is that you have to carefully remove every single remnant of the previous version of norton systemworks completely before you easily installs this.	negative
One more thing, the default ringtones that come with the new phone are quite horrible.	negative
first, it is a serious, serious installation problems encountered, indeed, overall.	negative
and i can 't warn you enough to stay safely far away from norton ! . ! .	negative
holy cow ! . it really does scratch easily and surprisingly, indeed ! surprisingly.	negative
but, i am quite unhappy and very frustrated with nokia at the moment overall.	negative
- no voice activated dialing feature at all ( what were they honestly thinking really	negative
If you are already using a previous version of Norton security and you uninstalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kinds of potential problems and issues in installing the new version on your system!	negative
A lot of various "fragments" were left in the registry, and it negatively affected the important essential norton system folders.	negative
The menu options appear one at a time, taking up the whole screen, and one has to scroll down one by one, or have memorized exactly where they are in the menu order, to select them by using the number keypad efficiently.	negative
Is it really necessary to scan my ms money database when I close the program, or really not at all?	negative
Ultimately, you will ultimately learn just how bad nokia really is, and why their recent loss of significant market share is so utterly deserved.	negative
It has an equalizer, but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more varied audio presets than the ipod.	negative
one notable downside : as of this current writing , t-mobile has n 't updated their t-zone system to fully support the popular nokia 6610 model.	negative
but this doesn 't make up for it 's numerous other short-comings, the biggest of which is the ongoing inability to download any critical updates due to ongoing problems with liveupdate.	negative
In my opinion, the worst overall design issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control feature.	negative
2) The phone is very awfully slow and quite frustrating for users.	negative
I did it again and it was much worse the second time around, which is . . . unbelievable.	negative
It's important that people know the following critical information: first, the user interface is quite slow and ineffective.	negative
The only main problem is the size of the keys overall.	negative
I have never had this specific particular issue with any other software on my computer system.	negative
the keys are quite close together, and the overall layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads, but it's not too weird at all.	negative
I finally got a free support number for Norton through my USP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a frustrating voice response.	negative
I can not find a suitable mobile carrier for this phone I really like, and I end up just tossing it carelessly in my purse.	negative
there is no way you can talk directly with customer care about this specific issue.	negative
My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate and somewhat fragile, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn’t get all scratched up.	negative
Though nearly a dozen different people at both t-mobile and nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to reliably use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices.	negative
just the home version of norton internet/av security software has too many annoying glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.	negative
It also has a stock tracking app built in (also useless) and a somewhat useful application which conveniently converts various types of metrics (currency, length, area, etc).	negative
buttons do seem a little bit sticky tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a potential problem in some cases . .	negative
The biggest problem is the extremely complex installation process.	negative
What disappoints me the most is that a software product like that is not cheap and gets zero customer support from Symantec, and if you want additional support, they’ll charge you a high fee!	negative
This product is absolutely definitely still not ready for public release yet.	negative
the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed essential components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions .	negative
The volume key can be somewhat hard to press sometimes, but I think this may be by design rather than a possible flaw, perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call.	negative
namely, it simply wouldn't sync properly at all.	negative
no problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has sadly abandoned their loyal customers completely and utterly.	negative
I have found too many serious bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional software to recommend it to anyone without extreme patience and experience.	negative
It seems the "program scan" feature unexpectedly did not find the exe file for outlook at all!	negative
also if you do manage to successfully get it installed, any potential problems with liveupdate or with system works will also negatively affect the overall functionality and/or the process of updating internet security.	negative
- some useful, helpful, and relevant features in the user interface design	negative
also, the battery's aren’t very user friendly and easily replaceable.	negative
it was a significant unexpected critical symantec error.	negative
we constantly got "windows virtual memory low" error messages popping up regularly followed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or frequent crashes.	negative
During the install process, the nis system would either completely freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.	negative
*	negative
buying complex software that can not be installed normally and being put into the unfortunate position of having a non-working computer system.	negative
4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one device, and that theory -once again- proves wrong, this phone excels at nothing, less than average in everything, if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities, you will be disappointed. . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of cool gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done.	negative
when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is truly a phone that isn 't easy to out-grow .	negative
our norton internet/av 2004 was terrible right from the very beginning, so i 'd think that if steelworks is ok now, it should remain just ok overall.	negative
i 'm an advocate of nokia, but this particular phone and the following models (7610), are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one rather sloppy phone.	negative
there will be much careful erasing of text as well, one would tend to quickly type something instead of the actual letters rapidly.	negative
I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather the potential problems that may frequently surface during the installation process - can be quite frustrating to the average computer user.	negative
only if we could somehow get one small camera in it too . .	negative
3 no voice recorder -- this has also become an important and quite popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have in the competitive market.	negative
a bit slightly disappoint on that recent event! .	negative
If you have no previous version of nortron security on your system, or nortron antivirus software, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and carefully in to do a major thorough registry clean up! The old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.	negative
4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a significant pain experience for users if one is particularly fond of text messaging.	negative
The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily, frequently.	negative
- no proprietary headset jack available for use	negative
and , when you thoughtfully think about it , it 's somewhat insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these unnecessary hoops -- anyone who can provide valid proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? . ) , should have equal priority.	negative
Only one complaint about the speakerphone feature, you can only easily activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone, not while it is ringing loudly.	negative
The t610 supports only standard midi music files.	negative
While I was trying to play Half Life 2, it started popping up with "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off again.	negative
there technical service isn 't very helpful either; they just read what 's on their official website and charge you $50 ( + toll fees ) to do it all.	negative
when I finally got it working successfully, it only worked properly for many a long challenging month.	negative
The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was still sadly riddled with numerous scratches.	negative
i see many other recent reviews that say the same thing . . . . stay away from norton , they don 't deserve you , or anyone else ! .	negative
i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorola ) it might be somewhat good overall overall . . . . but if you 're getting a nokia , don 't get this one at all .	negative
In short - nokia themselves don 't clearly know that this phone does not work with the palm device, and if you don 't heed my helpful advice you will potentially spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.	negative
then, my ad/pop-up blocking feature was completely gone and temporarily disabled.	negative
they really are awfully very small indeed.	negative
Regarding PC software support, Nokia Suite unfortunately does not work very well with some versions of XP, as I tried to connect my phone via the infrared port on my laptop.	negative
poor visibility on the small keys and screen display.	negative
doesn't have a lot of many good games on it.	negative
Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service, you often get frustratingly useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident fee.	negative
I have carefully read the detailed installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same disappointing result . . . junk software.	negative
The 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless and unhelpful for most average users.	negative
I've always liked various useful symantec products, except for this particular version 2004.	negative
don 't use them often, so i delete them for extra addle space and clarity.	negative
the overall vibration is not top quality enough.	negative
As a windows user, I had to install the necessary software including various drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a slight minor nuisance.	negative
however, in my opinion, $299 is quite a lot to pay for a device that will only last approximately 18 months.	negative
their site offers absolutely no live help support assistance at all.	negative
my only small gripe about the hardware is the buttons.	negative
One other issue is that the headphone jack is somewhat unique to Nokia, so standard regular headphones will not work properly as intended.	negative
The back of the ipod is in a shiny chrome finish, and this surface is highly prone to various scratches.	negative
This current version of internet security in 2004, is beyond all hope.	negative
when talking, the overall voice quality is not very clear at all.	negative
The only problem I had was a few crucial components didn’t quite load correctly upon initial startup, but a quick reboot fixed the problem effectively.	negative
Games kind of stink and you really can't easily download them; you have to get the link cable to easily get additional games.	negative
the total overall volume of liquid.	negative
there is absolutely nothing useful or relevant at the symantec/norton security website available.	negative
I assumed they had exceptional service, but their overall reception in my area (Los Angeles) is still horrendous.	negative
Norton has been on a downhill slide recently with their products, but with this particular one, they have truly fallen off the metaphorical cliff.	negative
the battery issue is superficially a minor concern , but any reasonable skilled solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can easily pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a quick go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' ) .	negative
I was using a Motorola t720i with Verizon, and I had a lot of dropped calls and I had serious troubles syncing important data occasionally.	negative
Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy and problematic implementations frequently encountered.	negative
the only major problem i had was a small annoying glitch with t-mobile service.	negative
so I e-mailed the online tech support team with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive and disappointing (it looked as though they didn’t actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few generic boilerplate paragraphs of text).	negative
This phone is not very suitable for fast-paced people, maybe only for elderly old people.	negative
5 ) The video recorder is of no use and one can not effectively record something useful in just 10 seconds, and it takes a while to send the same through the " free picture and video messaging " offered by the service provider.	negative
After 4 frustrating attempted installs, I have finally given up completely and utterly.	negative
but i had to give you four stars because the service for my brand-new ipod was terribly slow and quite frustrating.	negative
I am quite bored with the dull silver look now.	negative
I am an advanced computer user, so I can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terribly inefficient program to work efficiently and effectively!	negative
Even though I have the parental controls off, it constantly starts updating them, which then unexpectedly freezes my computer.	negative
Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this task, and neither does Norton’s own removal program effectively perform well.	negative
The phone has a few minor inconveniences overall, but only because it somewhat lacks those specific features, bluetooth and high spend internet, but there are very few actual problems with things that you expected this phone to do.	negative
once again it won 't reinstall properly, even with helpful online and email assistance from symantec technicians.	negative
Buy this interesting item if you like mental challenges or trying out how to pick locks effectively.	negative
it would not hang up unexpectedly on crucial important calls.	negative
The screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty policy you should be able to swap it out.	negative
I am giving a zero star rating to Symantec for this latest version release!	negative
Then when I went to Norton 's official website to easily obtain a priority ID number per the specific instructions I had been given, I couldn 't find a clear way to get one.	negative
there are some important key features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient overall.	negative
this time, it started the installation process smoothly, then i left for work. i think it will work. i hope it will work.	negative
The best thing to do with this particular version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It simply doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your valuable time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.	negative
I find this particular feature on this phone completely useless, but, since I don't really need this specific function anyway, I don’t really use it at all.	negative
The more subtle tones that were included with the new phone model are quite hard to hear at times.	negative
Sure, they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged, but they are the ones who ultimately get to decide whether it 's truly their fault.	negative
The pc cable is simply too incredibly expensive and ridiculous . . . $ 50 for a basic usb cable ? .	negative
this program would not let me send my outlook email or easily listen to audible sample books online.	negative
The menu pops up after 3 seconds, and the picture takes a little while to slowly load from its slow card memory.	negative
it unfortunately locked during the install process and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! . )	negative
After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the persistent problem, the only answer was to simply uninstall the program (which I had already done). . .	negative
this phone definitely doesn 't include the essential basic phone card calling feature.	negative
booting up my old computer took forever ! . ! . ! .	negative
so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't fully mastered how to scandisk effectively when using various internet security features.	negative
i could hardly use it without a quick recharge in 2 days!	negative
we can start by losing the shiny, fragile miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "asking" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.	negative
there is no photo viewing option, however, there is a nice 20 gb photo ipod available, but it costs $20 more overall.	negative
I must have frustratingly heard this complaint about a dozen times over the long span of 2 weeks, when t-zones never worked effectively.	negative
i had a simple question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 long frustrating minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a valid " customer priority id number. "	negative
I 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software overall, unfortunately.	negative
Basically, the 6600 is a bundle of somewhat over-hyped features you don't and won't really need (if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc), none of them work as they should, and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average, overall.	negative
The internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's specific services, because they have deleted the specific menu options that would enable you to easily configure the phone to be used on a different network.	negative
I had recently tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it simply wouldn't let me do that either.	negative
2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are quite sloppy to use.	negative
Among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a slightly bit vague design overall.	negative
Sometimes when you quickly press the buttons, the menu surprisingly appears after a second or two.	negative
it also does n 't have the voice activated dialing feature, which is a big significant minus ! . ! .	negative
I mean, they are really very short in comparison! .	negative
again, every single review written about the tech line is truly accurate and consistent . . . after waiting close to 45 long minutes, I finally spoke to a customer rep.	negative
just don 't easily get drawn into t-mobile 's catchy promotional rebate attractive offer.	negative
However, the calls constantly drop in my area and I experience significant mega-static issues, to the point where I'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line repeatedly.	negative
Finally, after about a week of continuous and heavy daily use, the screen started to freeze on me.	negative
if you currently own the popular 2003 version , and are seriously looking to upgrade to the newer 2004 version , please don 't.	negative
I will say that the operating system that the phone runs does indeed have a few minor software issues.	negative
The small photos in the address book are terribly scaled too poorly; they look as though they were built out of colorful lego's.	negative
however, symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this recent software release overall.	negative
they said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to " handle " and ship a cd ? . -- and they have been quite indignant, rude, and combative on the phone and in various emails.	negative
the menu options are uncreative and quite limited, as you can't see a full screen of menu items to pick from; you have to scroll up and down to find what you're looking for (yes, this is minor, but not when you're trying to keep your eye on the road!).	negative
there are some notable highs to the 2004 edition overall, but mostly lows.	negative
now the unfortunate bad news: 1) as usual, battery power not sufficient for daily typical usage.	negative
Secondly, in addition to the noticeable lag each time you give a command, it’s just not that easily usable on the go for users.	negative
multiple users on one single shared machine never quite seemed to behave like you’d expect.	negative
Since I received the new phone, I spent countless frustrating hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised that t-zones would work "in 24 hours."	negative
Their network coverage is very sporadic, and the network always seems heavily overloaded, resulting in a very unpleasant calling experience overall.	negative
the battery life can 't be very long ; in fact, let 's not be greedy .	negative
first, it consistently failed whenever connecting to get important critical system updates.	negative
My old sony ericsson t610 has this very useful and handy feature indeed.	negative
Although I unfortunately disabled the Norton antispam feature, it is still there, sadly.	negative
After 10 years, I now downloaded McAfee's product after calling their support team. They answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful.	negative
Other things that I miss are useful voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack.	negative
after several years of frustrating and tedious torture in the hands of at&t customer service, i am delighted to finally drop them, and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile happily! .	negative
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerously annoying when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no easy way to change this --	negative
this is only a minor technical problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.	negative
I downloaded this software set from Norton, and within minutes, my internet connection suddenly failed, and my PC was almost dead due to serious registry problems from the download.	negative
yeah - this program effectively protects your computer all right - by completely and totally locking you off the internet entirely.	negative
the " entertaining movies " generally last about 5 brief seconds only.	negative
At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated and somewhat challenging overall.	negative
The program brings more problems than a common virus, albeit not as major problems, just simply not what you typically expect for 70 bucks.	negative
long reboots due to Norton software taking forever and ever to boot properly.	negative
next, the big reason not to buy any norton product: if there’s a significant problem with it, norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.	negative
I am genuinely glad that I do not work for Norton anymore, honestly.	negative
If you are new to the market and looking to buy a specific Symantec software product, save yourself some money and wisely buy the 2003 version.	negative
You also need to go in and manually remove several unnecessary symantec files from the system registry carefully.	negative
Nokia was my first non flip phone device, and I 'm glad I decided to go with them.	positive
Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than expensive refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and it also has a larger overall capacity for storage.	positive
While this phone obviously doesn 't have the same high quality construction as motorola does, the nokia 6600 is one of the better overall phones I 've used recently.	positive
4. play various exciting fun n-gage games on it happily together.	positive
The built in fm radio is excellent for many different people traveling by public transport daily.	positive
update i always knew that i truly loved the champ , and using the diaper genie at a friend's house really reinforced that strong feeling ! .	positive
I have had the original iPod Mini and it performs quite well on the overall level with my sound card, but the micro beats it outright.	positive
The photos are pretty darned good overall!	positive
which is really nice because you can get pretty much any popular piece of music in midi format for free on the vast online net.	positive
the player looks really great overall, feels great consistently, and sounds great too.	positive
I have successfully transferred in about 2,400 music tracks so far - very easy to use both the iPod and the iTunes platform, overall.	positive
the card basically installed itself and the " install wizard " on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work efficiently with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card ) effectively and smoothly.	positive
I ended up buying one very convenient item for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.	positive
The speaker phone is very functional and I regularly use it in the car, as it is very audible even with freeway noise.	positive
and the phone has a very cool and useful feature which allows you to easily send images via a normal pop3/smtp e-mail account effortlessly.	positive
I have no problems at all with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the user interface is truly a breeze to easily use without even looking at the pdf manual.	positive
I must have possibly gotten a really good deal one today.	positive
its compact design and has smooth, sleek rounded edges.	positive
Battery life is quite good, although I recommend two reliable rechargeable batteries, or an alkaline backup option, for those important emergency pics you have to have.	positive
we use regular kitchen sized black plastic garbage bags.	positive
The display quality and overall brightness on this phone is truly quite extraordinary.	positive
Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not particularly difficult to connect, and the software worked fairly well to connect.	positive
the ringtones included are truly awesome, and did i mention they were polyphonic sounds too?	positive
The movie mode is also working quite great and effectively well.	positive
A new nikon camera will likely make you happier and leave you with lots of good memories, as always.	positive
it has great incredible quality and overall incredibility as well.	positive
Right out of the box, I really loved it, better features than the iPod, great sound quality and no real limitations on what music sources I can easily use.	positive
it 's a highly rated , kick ass firewall program that 's bundled with the venerable norton antivirus , plus additional helpful extras ( like norton antispam & norton parental control ) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have fast broadband internet access .	positive
it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod . . . my nokia cell phone easily towers over this amazing little bad boy ! .	positive
Nokia makes great quality phones, and this one is truly the very cream of the crop.	positive
a decent piece of hardware with impressive and great speed ( i get the same speeds as with my computer connected directly to the modem ) and good signal quality overall.	positive
their amazing innovative products have been incredibly great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.	positive
The sound is actually very nice and quite pleasant today.	positive
Perhaps semantic analysis could work out the overall efficiency a little bit, but these reviews are highly exaggerated and misleading. I would sincerely ask what else these people are possibly running on their computers ( ? . )	positive
the nikon coolpix 4300 is truly wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and very compact in overall size .	positive
I hooked the linksys wireless router up to a reliable and stable broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download speed easily!	positive
the battery has a very long and impressive overall life span and durability.	positive
The 6600 ( T-Mobile ) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the necessary MHz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia ( 900 MHz ) whereas the 6620 ( available from Singular ) replaces it with 800MHz ( some refer to it as 850 MHz ).	positive
The software with the new sleek ipod includes the useful itunes application, which allows you to play the music on your computer, easily rip cds onto your computer, and seamlessly move your music from the computer to the ipod.	positive
great camera overall, and for the reasonable price you really can’t beat it.	positive
The champ works really great overall and efficiently.	positive
however, the overall battery life is quite good enough, so you should n’t be overly concerned with turning this phone off.	positive
Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is truly the only diaper pail to get for all busy parents!	positive
It looks sleek, stylish, and has a modern design overall.	positive
The installation process was as nearly automatic as it can be done.	positive
smaller size, 1 gb of more space, built-in radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one compact device.	positive
Anywhere I went in beautiful South Africa, this phone consistently received full bar reception quality everywhere.	positive
really very happy with this little compact camera device.	positive
it 's rechargeable and supposedly very easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course recently, at least.	positive
I like some local radio stations, stern talk, and npr news, and so the radio clearly seemed like a very great option.	positive
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus software separately or install two separate disks simultaneously.	positive
- outstanding signal reception quality overall performance level	positive
High quality video and pictures truly rock indeed!	positive
the 6600 has more impressive modern amenities than most - world phone , camera ( vga/zoom/night mode/timer ) , video ( w/ audio & zoom ) , speaker ( good sound ) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and additional more features.	positive
the phone itself is actually pretty nice overall for everyday casual use.	positive
but it is very smooth, it is extremely powerful, it is quite affordable & it has a proven and reliable track record.	positive
this unit now conveniently comes with the standard usb/firewire cable as a standard item included.	positive
great phone model design quality review experience . . .	positive
The radio works excellent in my area, but I’m not sure about everywhere else.	positive
I never, in fact, ever really get dropped phone calls.	positive
at works as well as can be reasonably expected for various products in this specific space and the company reliably backs it up with good support.	positive
- looks sleek, compact, has a built-in radio feature.	positive
I must add to the dismay/delight of curious and eager readers that this new phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.	positive
The radio and voice recording quality are very nice indeed overall.	positive
it is a bit somewhat difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and actively exploring , i consider this a positive attribute overall ! .	positive
and we definitely prefer our amazing champion team overall in this context! .	positive
It offers way more useful and practical features than I really need, but the specific ones I use work well.	positive
i finally decided to purchase this specific music player because it was compatible with napster 2 go . . . . which is a subscription service , allowing me to easily download as much music as i want for a $14 . 95 flat fee.	positive
With all its complicated features, the menus are quite easily accessible and the overall quality of the various features is truly great.	positive
i rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism , but something about the sleek new ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , " i want that one ! . " i was willing to shell out	positive
I noticed that the small micro adjustment knob and collet are very well made and work very well too consistently.	positive
You can easily adjust the volume level to be heard anywhere or so that it does not make that big of a disturbance.	positive
The total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was $135 dollars in total!	positive
the dual antenna is a significant plus and the overall design is really sleek and slick.	positive
Uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast, efficient, and incredibly simple to do.	positive
I bought this really slick new phone recently and I am very happy with it overall.	positive
my friends were really impressed with the unexpectedly high quality of the amazing pictures i took recently ! .	positive
After using it, I found the overall size to be quite perfect for easily carrying in a small, compact pocket.	positive
i 've yet to find the clear limitation for this excellent hitachi tool ( my only hitachi tool, by the way ) and quite frankly, i don 't know that i have the muscle strength to push this powerful machine any harder .	positive
Even with that minor issue, I still highly recommend this excellent router - truly outstanding performer overall.	positive
Remember, this phone uses an advanced operating system - Symbian. . . and it 's feature-rich w/ 65k vibrant and vivid colors.	positive
if you really need a new wireless router . . . . get it get it get it . . . . works really good . . . .	positive
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper overall in comparison.	positive
It 's easy to use effectively, and yet very feature rich and helpful tool.	positive
6 ) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many different people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic and comfortable overall .	positive
Believe me when I confidently say this, I have used and thoroughly tested fingered all Nokia phones, and the 6600 has the best overall keypad.	positive
the plusses are the various impressive features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and overall robustness, quality.	positive
Each battery typically lasts about 10-11 hours on average average duration.	positive
I upgraded from nis 2003, and the overall change in overall performance has not been noticeably significant at all.	positive
One of my favorite features about the media player is its amazing ability to easily sync to the popular windows media player.	positive
the range is truly terrific, i am using this for my home network and i was transferring data at 50+mbs from my backyard.	positive
I loaded a lot of beautiful and stunning photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the smooth transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous.	positive
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty surprisingly sturdy and functional.	positive
works perfectly and seamlessly with my reliable netgear wireless paramecia device setup.	positive
I really liked the fair price overall.	positive
colors : 10 variety of vibrant hot colors made it very difficult to choose from.	positive
Get great themes and stylish wallpapers for this amazing phone and many many unique polyphonic rings available for users.	positive
After the installation process, which was very simple and straightforward, I quickly downloaded any updated software from the creative website, before I downloaded any music files.	positive
All of the wireless components that I bought were actually a breeze to set up as well.	positive
but that is actually good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not very savvy on computers .	positive
Overall, this product is truly quite awesome and incredibly impressive indeed.	positive
In a week of regular daily use, I've never had to reboot the wireless router.	positive
there seem to be noticeably fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router recently observed.	positive
This phone has the best overall battery performance, it reliably lasts longer than my old 3210 model.	positive
The auto-focus performs quite well, but I love having the 12 additional optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof, and correspond to many different situations in which I would actually seek to use the camera effectively.	positive
Other than that, it meets or surpasses all of my basic needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans at all, really.	positive
pros : - excellent sound quality, even with the basic headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set, overall.	positive
Being a very economical person, I truly appreciate the simple fact that any single plastic bag can be conveniently used with this system - I never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills.	positive
The overall general reception and sound quality are top-notch.	positive
this is a great product indeed! 	positive
the clarity is unbelievably high, which means you can easily cram almost the full 2, 5 times efficiently! .	positive
flawless design quality standards.	positive
it 's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller in overall size.	positive
the soft start is really nice, gentle, smooth, and pleasant.	positive
when i opened the large, mysterious box , i was shocked by the surprisingly small size of this thing . . . it 's really tiny ! .	positive
I can use it as a reliable and efficient modem for my computer, connect easily and quickly with clients and friends, the possibilities are truly endless.	positive
Its compact size and lightweight design also makes it an ideal choice for convenient travel.	positive
The main significant advantage of this advanced system over its predecessor is the unique ability to seamlessly open a wider data pipeline between clients.	positive
I am extremely satisfied with this truly amazing camera product overall.	positive
you actually can easily talk to a real person for support in under one hour time! . ) .	positive
while it didn't have all the essential features i would have truly liked, it was still better than anything else i could find at the time.	positive
so far i have no serious complaints with this player.	positive
while i like the overall performance of the phone in every single regard , i would definitely buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .	positive
It looks very nice and sleek, and the blue background light looks truly awesome against the smooth black surface.	positive
My favorite features, although there are many unique ones, are the speaker phone, the radio, and the infrared.	positive
when i turned the phone on, the first thing that hit me is how surprisingly good the display screen is.	positive
it's a bit pricey to call home from various other countries, but the instant messaging to and from several covered countries in europe are quite reasonable overall.	positive
From the internet, various woodworking books, local stores, and personal opinions, the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price overall.	positive
I have really enjoyed the camera feature on this amazing phone device.	positive
also, with one single click, you can easily help effectively train your efficient spam killer tool.	positive
upside : this one , like most nokias , consistently receives a reliably strong signal ( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front ) .	positive
3 it is very compact but the controls are actually so well designed that they 're still quite easy to use, overall.	positive
All you have to do is simply click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the nearby devices and effortlessly configures the network seamlessly.	positive
The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your fair share of vibrant, smooth animations and appealing icons on your phone.	positive
It is a perfect and functional phone in such a small, sleek, and appealing package design.	positive
In the auto mode, it functions basically as a simple point and click tool, the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results overall.	positive
The overall battery life on this amazing phone is truly surreal.	positive
I got this amazing new camera about a month ago and I can't put it down.	positive
my op ion is concentrate on what you really need now, this product has an excellent range, holds a solid teddy connection, has even sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now.	positive
I am enjoying my new phone a lot today while using it constantly.	positive
the overall battery life is generally less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness efficiently.	positive
they were easy to setup with plenty of impressive overall power to effortlessly hog through anything i have encountered.	positive
3. the nokia 6600 has a brilliantly designed java and user-friendly interface overall.	positive
it sits quietly in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife ) .	positive
it 's very easy to use ( just a simple flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .	positive
First of all, the phone houses a great deal of impressive internal memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, and various other data, etc.	positive
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly fine.	positive
the hitachi tool is made in malaya, and looked somewhat cheap and inferior compared with the makita, which is made in the usa.	positive
While the perfect odor-free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the diaper champ is overall generally as good as it gets, overall.	positive
The manual mode is feature rich and I can't wait to fully understand and get the hang of it very soon.	positive
I 've owned this very reliable wireless router for over 8 long years and am somewhat satisfied with it.	positive
I got it working quite fast enough now, indeed, overall.	positive
the sturdy wood can be easily pushed thru very fast or slow with little bog.	positive
it is very light weight and has a surprisingly good overall signal strength performance.	positive
In short, the Nokia 6600 is a notable, significant technological evolution but not a major revolution.	positive
Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone system and improve people’s experience! . ! . ! .	positive
i 'd give it 4 . 5 neutral average stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i honestly give it 4 stars .	positive
everything , so far , has worked flawlessly, smoothly, effectively and efficiently .	positive
dependability : i 've seen absolutely no glitches or major issues at all.	positive
Their customer service agents are always very prompt, professional, and polite, and my overall service experience is terrific.	positive
very cool features . . . great camera with zoom . . . cool quality pictures . . . great ringtones . . . bluetooth feature is really great . . . very helpful.	positive
these include: mp3, wave, wma, wma pro, and wma lossless formats; it is very user-friendly and efficient simply by right-clicking the selected file(s) to be converted easily.	positive
however, there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd (and online) that should effectively answer any potential questions about the operational features of the zen micro device effectively.	positive
it is quite slow to initially start up, but once it 's finally turned on, i 've never had any serious complaints about the overall speed.	positive
Since then, I have not found one major problem with it at all.	positive
why bother when it works perfectly fine with media player 10 then really, right?	positive
really simple, convenient, and easy to use interface.	positive
I have had the phone for 1 week, and the signal quality has been generally great in the Detroit area (suburbs) and in my recent road trip between Detroit and northern Kentucky (Cincinnati) I experienced perfect signal and reception along I-75, which is far superior to at &#38; . t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route at all.	positive
i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3 . 5 ) , but unfortunately , i am returning it now.	positive
however , setting up the process using the quick start instructions was a breeze .	positive
I love the unique touchpaper controls system.	positive
but it really is worth it overall ; . you won 't regret it at all.	positive
pros: large hard drive for the overall $$ -- 20gb and 40gb options are both still very affordable.	positive
I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can easily use regular garbage bags very conveniently.	positive
i really love how small the interesting little thing is, and the blue glow - i 've had it for two weeks with no major electronic problems at all.	positive
20 gb or 40 gb? The notable pros of the 40 gb option: comes with a "dock station" and double the storage space (10,000 songs) available for users.	positive
great phone, very easy to use, excellent network, no regrets at all, truly! . ! . ! .	positive
It is a truly great smartphone device, if you are traveling all over the world, packed with many wonderful and useful features.	positive
Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library collection, the 20 gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold approximately 5000 songs in total.	positive
but you can easily download some really good and popular ones like pac-man or mafia wars mobile games.	positive
I use the scented bags and even if I don't notice any smell at all!	positive
i 'll be getting a second one for my new router table soon! 	positive
It also has tons of more exciting features than previous creative products, and most of them are actually very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the preferred stuff you want, not the default items (creative labs . com for more on that).	positive
applications : it has lots of different practical applications and they work very well together . . . when you eventually find out where they are and they finally open up.	positive
fm tuner & microphone: having a small tuner in the player is truly a blessing.	positive
The supplied headphones are hands-down significantly better than the very mediocre ipod buds overall.	positive
I first used the router tool in the free hand mode and liked it a lot overall, surprisingly.	positive
I also truly love that you can easily and conveniently flip the portable device with one hand. . .	positive
The overall battery life is generally good for a phone of this compact size.	positive
- small portable speakerphone device gadget	positive
enjoy the simple and quiet moment fully.	positive
I have successfully ripped over 100 popular songs from my CD collection, and it was incredibly easy and fast, and they all sound great overall.	positive
I have had no problem either with backward compatibility, in that the "mixed mode" feature conveniently lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router.	positive
Norton pops up a helpful security window about the recent intrusions and gives me as much detailed information as possible about where the potential intrusion is possibly coming from.	positive
The nokia 6600 is a great phone overall, with good games, solid good camera features.	positive
Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was quite easy to understand, and he effectively helped me solve the problem quickly and efficiently.	positive
It has a classic, timeless, elegant design yet looks stylish, hip, and modern.	positive
2 it is very easy enough for my grandmother to use clearly, effectively, and simply.	positive
the sound quality is great, the impressive portability features, etc. . . . all the " stuff " you expect from a good mp-3 player, this zen micro has it.	positive
The setup process is totally a breeze and Linksys's web site is quite surprisingly pretty easy to navigate and understand.	positive
yes, the impressive features are numerous indeed and very helpful for users.	positive
well, i have an ipod mini - and i really like it a lot, but all in all, i like the zen micro more.	positive
it 's very easy to use device overall. not too small , and not too big .	positive
The songs recorded with advanced fm technology are just as good as the original signal quality.	positive
the sturdy guide fence for accurate freehand routing is well made and solid.	positive
So far, the anti-spam feature seems to be very good overall and quite effective.	positive
better for the zen micro is the very useful outlook compatibility feature.	positive
with one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook, support for thousands of useful applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on (i own the ir remote, iq and a few other amazing devices), the nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from t-mobile that can claim such a distinct honor.	positive
it has lots of little cute features, my favorite being the various fun games and the pim (personal information manager -- i.e. organizer), and the radio station!	positive
I highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of useful and handy features you would definitely find in a pda.	positive
this amazing innovative gadget does everything but washes your dirty dishes.	positive
These tasks are notably faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable and efficient overall.	positive
and really this is the best overall smartphone one could possibly have available.	positive
I think that for its reasonable price compared to the popular ipod, the creative zen is actually pretty good overall.	positive
It may not top the ipod mini, but it 's definitely a fairly solid alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality overall.	positive
Downloads are a snap, really simple, fast, and quick too.	positive
If you 're looking for a reliable and affordable 3hp plunge router, the hitachi m12v is truly your best bet to stretch your equipment budget wisely.	positive
In conclusion, I gave the iPod a solid, overall 4/5 rating because anything this expensive should ideally work just about flawlessly.	positive
With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn baby, it was really great how incredibly easy and convenient it was to dispose of the dirty ones quickly.	positive
the sound quality is quite good overall, in terms of volume and clarity.	positive
I own this smartphone for about 6 months now, and I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), and I have many movies on it now with a 512mb memory card that it takes.	positive
this is one of the nicest and sleek modern phones that nokia has made recently.	positive
this is the first amazing phone i know of that has the large bright colorful screen, infrared, bluetooth, usb connector and a speakerphone.	positive
I highly recommend this excellent camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does not take weeks to figure out how to operate efficiently.	positive
The i-pod is honestly the best overall device thing I have ever used personally.	positive
it's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED light looks super cool around the beautiful edges.	positive
this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit and useful tool.	positive
This is really a nice and convenient diaper pail for busy parents.	positive
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargeable battery the compact charging unit, which is included, is fast, small, and efficient.	positive
the user interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.	positive
The software you get with this camera is really quite absolutely perfect overall.	positive
the zen micro fm receiver is somewhat ok overall, not very great at all.	positive
So far, I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and I find them very well designed, and relatively easy to understand overall.	positive
I had a Sony Ericsson T610 phone before this, and the T610 is still far inferior.	positive
it gives you the most valuable overall bang for your buck, period, really.	positive
2) nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception, and overall quality.	positive
it also works just fine for various international calls.	positive
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation, 35mb memory card to conveniently and easily store the pictures and other stuff.	positive
moving on to the sound department team . . . it truly delivers effectively indeed! .	positive
the auto-mode is good enough for most casual shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual mode.	positive
the modern design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool, stylish, and trendy (and i think trendy = good, but it 's always really hard to tell these days).	positive
sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90, the impressive ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording important reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention... the overall sound quality is truly excellent!	positive
Its ability to easily record various radio broadcasts is quite useful as well, but would have been more so if it could be preset.	positive
this is a great phone and reliable device I have used this phone since feb 04 and I never have any problem at all.	positive
With Bluetooth currently off, the phone lasts almost twice as long now, overall.	positive
excellent phone, the phone looks much better than what you see in the pictures overall, indeed, truly.	positive
The battery on mine lasts 2 full days if I don’t play games that much, and it only takes 90 minutes to fully charge from flat.	positive
For me, it is as equally important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it consistently produce a high-quality result.	positive
It is truly amazing that the small battery lasts so incredibly long when the phone is very small and light.	positive
settings for just about everything, stunning and beautiful pics and various beautiful prints that are high-quality.	positive
looks and durability: i realize many people are quite fond of the popular minimalist white interface design.	negative
a bit disappoint on that specific situation indeed! .	negative
My file log was not responding properly and the program was not effectively blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites reliably.	negative
First of all, I’ve never been very big on earbuds - they’re just not that comfortable at all for me.	negative
Norton online support does not even acknowledge this ongoing critical problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer device.	negative
i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorola ) it might be somewhat good . . . . but if you 're getting a nokia , don 't get this specific one, honestly.	negative
i already knew something was clearly wrong, because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was primarily from various resellers of norton products.	negative
Unfortunately, the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone, but the other very impressive and notable features it packs outweighs this minor shortcoming.	negative
this simple nuance was too much for nokia, and they still refuse to adequately acknowledge the fact that their technician could have possibly broken the phone or repaired the phone for free.	negative
If you experience serious technical problems with installation, you can visit Symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support,' and there is a helpful automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer, and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.	negative
also, not liking the gel case design style at all.	negative
If you are already using a previous version of Norton security and uninstalled it to install the new version, you will still likely encounter all kinds of various problems in installing the new version on your system!	negative
durability : not good . first problem , if you haven 't seen the recent news recently , the ipods are being recalled for serious battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months effectively.	negative
the " exciting movies " typically last about 5 seconds only.	negative
As with most average headphones that come with any type of music player, I highly recommend throwing these outdated devices into the nearest river, unless you truly like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears.	negative
I did it and it was actually much worse the second time around, really . . . unbelievable .	negative
my ipod sometimes freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a fun and exciting game of " brick . "	negative
Although I find it somewhat more convenient to use 1-touch dialing, this particular phone does not have useful voice dialing features.	negative
After telling the rep and his tech supervisor about the ongoing problem, the only answer was to simply uninstall the program (which I had already done) . . .	negative
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerously annoying when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's simply no way to easily change this --	negative
Games kind of stink and you really can't easily download them; you have to get the link cable to get additional game options.	negative
this time, it started the installation process successfully, then i left for work. i think it will work. i hope it will work.	negative
one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n 't updated their t-zone system to fully support the latest popular 6610 model.	negative
T-Mobile wasn't very upfront about some of the unclear and somewhat confusing terms to qualify for the rebate.	negative
If you are new to the market and looking to buy a specific Symantec software product, then save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version today.	negative
1-a cell phone is primarily used to make calls, in other words, quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important features, the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker, you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything clearly and properly the other person is saying, unless the surroundings were completely quiet and still.	negative
it also does n 't have the very useful voice activated dialing feature. big minus ! . ! .	negative
Our norton internet/av 2004 was terrible right from the very beginning, so I’d honestly think that if steelworks is okay now, it should remain okay.	negative
It was immediately noticeably quite apparent that nis significantly slows down my old computer ( pent4 , 256 ram ) .	negative
cons breaks easily, often, and frequently.	negative
the total overall volume of liquid.	negative
Symantec should give us all a fair full refund and sincere heartfelt apology!	negative
just the home version of norton internet security/av software has too many annoying glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.	negative
After 4 frustrating attempted installs, I have finally given up completely and utterly.	negative
can 't get any easier than that really, honestly! .	negative
configuring it for a small home network was almost completely and utterly impossible.	negative
My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a durable and protective case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.	negative
I must have clearly heard this phrase about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks, when t-zones never worked effectively.	negative
customer service : awful . listen to this one, please kindly remember the battery statement i made earlier, please.	negative
It seems the " program scan " feature unfortunately did not find the required exe file for the outlook application.	negative
the menu options are uncreative and limited , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to easily pick from ; . you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is a minor inconvenience , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! . ) .	negative
so i e-mailed the online tech support team with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few generic and unhelpful boilerplate paragraphs).	negative
I had recently tried to uninstall the Norton Internet Security program a few weeks ago, and it simply wouldn't let me do that either.	negative
I have a modern gaming PC with lots of speed and memory, but this very annoying network firewall just brought it to a sudden halt.	negative
In a very noisy environment, it is hard to clearly hear sounds from the earpiece device.	negative
It was a significant ongoing technical symantec error issue.	negative
The speaker volume is very loud and remarkably clear but it sacrifices overall battery life significantly.	negative
The complex navigation process takes so much extra unnecessary time that it would eventually drive you completely crazy.	negative
Norton support is completely pathetic and unhelpful overall, unfortunately.	negative
The original ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and unfortunately gets scratched easily and quickly.	negative
and i can 't warn you enough to stay safely away from norton forever now ! . ! .	negative
Another important thing you should know is that the metal surface on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky and scratches very easily.	negative
then, my ad/pop-up blocking feature was completely and utterly gone forever.	negative
The gprs web access is very slow, inconvenient, and frustrating!	negative
After thoroughly scouring the various online discussion boards, I find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.	negative
however, it needs to be quite very quiet and still for it to work at all -- dosn 't work at all in the moving car, for example.	negative
this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online properly and effectively, unfortunately.	negative
The back of the ipod is in a shiny chrome finish, and this surface is notably prone to scratches.	negative
and the overall battery life is really bad overall indeed! .	negative
the number buttons are crammed into a small 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that very customizable as well, unfortunately.	negative
It is very buggy, slow, and basically frustrates the heck out of the average user overall.	negative
Personally, I may never buy any of the Symantec security products again.	negative
the user interface took a little extra time getting used to, initially.	negative
they unfortunately have the worst overall service of any of the major companies available today.	negative
Although I disabled the Norton antispam feature, it is still clearly very much still there.	negative
Is it really absolutely necessary to regularly scan my ms money database when I close the program every single time?	negative
like most of their various solutions ( which first blame other applications for several errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a minor microsoft error - it was not .	negative
While I was trying to play Half Life 2, it suddenly started popping up with "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me that my antivirus protection was unexpectedly off and disabled.	negative
4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one device, and that theory -once again- proves wrong, this phone sadly excels at nothing, less than average in everything, if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities, you'll be disappointed. . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of various gadgets then fine. . . . but don't expect to get much done.	negative
Sometimes when you press various buttons, the menu unexpectedly appears after a brief second or two.	negative
I have never had this specific technical problem with any other software on my computer before.	negative
they are a royal pain to install, and don’t function properly once finally installed -- if you can somehow easily install them at all, after all.	negative
As a loyal customer of norton/symantec products, I purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more extremely dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).	negative
the ms scandisk would appear due to a manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar, over and over (up to 1 hr, i then shut it down and used go back) repeatedly.	negative
t610 supports only basic standard general midi files.	negative
3 no voice recorder -- this has also become an important and very popular feature that the classic ipod unfortunately doesn 't have.	negative
The original hard drive screws up occasionally during normal daily usage.	negative
doesn't have a lot of really good and enjoyable games on it at all.	negative
long reboots due to norton software taking forever to boot properly slowly.	negative
Please kindly avoid this specific product at all costs for your own safety.	negative
So far, I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't quite mastered how to scandisk when using various internet security tools.	negative
Apple closed their island to anything that closely resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services for any purpose.	negative
I have excellent hearing, but the overall volume level on this phone is especially very quiet overall.	negative
The operating system is a bit confusing at first, but within a few days you will easily pass this steep learning curve!	negative
but if I installed either one of these two norton security products, neither of them works properly after installation?	negative
so, right out of the box, i had a very minor technical issue.	negative
this phone doesn 't include a phone card calling feature anymore unfortunately.	negative
However, I suspect that many people are having a truly really bad experience -- do not purchase this product.	negative
I finally got a free support phone number for Norton through my helpful and friendly USP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.	negative
The original apple 's ipod battery replacement service costs $100 in total! .	negative
the battery issue is superficially a somewhat minor concern , but any reasonably skilled solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can easily pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a quick go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' ) .	negative
If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been unfortunately damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and then quickly blame you for "abusing" your ipod.	negative
The numerous problems I had installing Norton software truly extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the general public to deal with.	negative
Unfortunately, I sold it exactly one month later, unexpectedly, surprisingly, and quite unexpectedly.	negative
Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service, you often get frustrating and useless automated systems unless you want to pay a hefty $30 per incident.	negative
The internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile's services, because they have deleted the specific menu options that would enable you to easily configure the phone to be used on a different network efficiently.	negative
When I got it home, I surprisingly discovered that the menu options for easily sending messages via either text or email simply weren't there at all.	negative
booting up my slow computer took forever ! . ! . ! .	negative
After several years of constant and unnecessary torture in the hands of at&t customer service, I am absolutely delighted to finally drop them, and I look forward to August 2004 when I will convert our other 3 family phones from at&t to t-mobile!	negative
I saw a few complaints on the overall load time of menus, and I genuinely feel people are over-exaggerating the actual menu load time.	negative
it's a complete total rip off if one buys Norton internet security and antivirus software online.	negative
now in october, 2004, the firewall suddenly said i couldn 't ok anymore additional software to use the internet because its full and overloaded.	negative
finally , i reiterate my honest thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier overall.	negative
I'm at full capacity now! . ! . ! . ! . I called Symantec and they said they don't know why but I should get tech's support at $35/hr to help me! . ! . I did call them and was on hold for 55 long frustrating minutes until I eventually hung up! .	negative
also, some other popular mp3 players such as the nitrus allow you to easily play various wma (windows media audio) files, whereas the ipod does not.	negative
Nothing particularly spectacular or remarkable is really done by internet security systems or by antivirus software programs.	negative
I find this particular feature on this phone completely useless, but, since I don’t really need this function anyway, I don’t really use it often.	negative
again, every single detailed review written about the tech line is indeed true. . . after waiting close to 45 long, frustrating minutes, I finally spoke to a rep.	negative
i 'm currently using a sony vaio s-150 laptop ( which i bought at the end of this past august ) , and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact , i 've taken to just hibernating , rather than shutting down completely.	negative
but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to easily download any updates due to persistent and frustrating problems with liveupdate system.	negative
The main downside is the overall size of the phone, it is quite big for today 's modern standard.	negative
I tried disabling the various components provided with this specific product, paring it all the way back to the basic anti-virus only service option, and saw no noticeable improvement at all.	negative
After 10 years, I now downloaded McAfee's product after calling their support team. They answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful.	negative
i simply hate symantec software so much. i swear, if i could have physically ripped that frustrating software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, i would have.	negative
I am an IT professional and have used Norton for many years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.	negative
Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this software, it had surprisingly taken me over 16 long hours to install and run successfully.	negative
the only problem i had was a small persistent glitch with t-mobile mobile service.	negative
this version of internet security 2004, is beyond any hope.	negative
From day one, we 've had numerous hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, long shutdowns due to the "cc app.exe" program running, which is a Norton security program malfunction.	negative
I have found too many serious bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to strongly recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.	negative
I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather the common problems that may commonly surface during the installation process - can be quite frustrating to the average computer user.	negative
In short - nokia themselves honestly don 't know that this phone simply doesn 't work with the palm, and if you don 't heed my helpful and sincere advice you will likely spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.	negative
the only con I can think of is the notable lack of a high-quality mega-pixel camera.	negative
and if you 're a mac user like me , they 've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative option available at all.	negative
During the install process, nis would either unexpectedly freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.	negative
I've always liked various reliable Symantec products, except for this particular version 2004.	negative
One complaint about the product is that the screen is unfortunately too easily scratched and damaged!	negative
cons : no am/fm radio tuner -- something a large number of various different competitors are currently doing	negative
Some of the higher pitched audio rings are very easy to hear, but not very easy to listen to clearly.	negative
The best thing to do with this particular version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It simply doesn’t work well, and will cost you an enormous amount of your valuable time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.	negative
Other important things that I miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard reliable 2.5 mm headset jack.	negative
I think it is a combination of the program size taking up limited resources and the open/close scanning process that it does with every single program systematically.	negative
When I purchase new software, I typically never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular, solutions that involve manually setting various driver preferences or editing the registry files!	negative
this is definitely one of those very popular products , especially as the company is leaning more strongly towards making a profit .	negative
I somewhat assumed they had exceptional service, but their reception in my area (Los Angeles) is quite horrendous.	negative
I downloaded this specific set from Norton, and within just a few minutes, my internet connection unexpectedly failed and my PC was almost dead due to serious registry problems from the download.	negative
also , their t-zones , although very cheap ( $ 4 . 99 / mo . ) never really works effectively for many users.	negative
The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's new player was relatively new, it was clearly and visibly riddled with numerous scratches.	negative
I 've searched the program thoroughly and their online tech support ( totally worthless ) and have found no viable solutions or options.	negative
they didn 't know what the significant major problem could be.	negative
However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this recent software release overall.	negative
The more subtle tones that were included with the new phone are often quite hard to hear at times.	negative
Then when I went to Norton’s official website to obtain a priority ID number per the clear instructions I had been given, I couldn’t find a clear way to get one.	negative
It has an equalizer, but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more useful presets than the ipod overall.	negative
namely, it wouldn't sync properly at all.	negative
First, let me say that I got the wonderful new 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself, honestly.	negative
After a recent update, I can no longer open more than 1 single browser window at all.	negative
only if we could get one small camera in it quickly . .	negative
you can " disable " some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled -- they 're still very much there and quietly running in the background.	negative
this is only a minor problem at night, during the bright day the screen is very easy to see clearly.	negative
Please kindly stay away from this specific product entirely!	negative
you can 't do that with a sony t610 mobile phone ( which i traded for a newer 6600 model ) .	negative
also if you do manage to get it successfully installed, any potential problems with liveupdate or with system works will also negatively affect the overall functionality and/or the process of updating internet security.	negative
- no voice activated dialing feature at all ( what were they possibly thinking	negative
The one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for T-Mobile lack many of the essential menus and functions that a Nokia straight from the manufacturer should typically have.	negative
Ringtones only come with crazy and loud songs and annoying rings, there is only one simple ring that sounds close to a regular phone ring.	negative
Their network coverage is very sporadic and the network always seems overloaded, resulting in a very unpleasant calling experience for many users.	negative
The only main problem is the overall significant size of the keys in general.	negative
I read many detailed reviews on Norton Internet Security 2004 from a variety of reputable sources (CNET, Amazon, various message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the costly update.	negative
I have carefully read the detailed installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and Navy 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same disappointing result... junk software.	negative
don 't use them often, so i delete them for extra addle space and storage.	negative
there is also no voice recording feature available, something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't .	negative
also, when i dial an "800" number like an airline company, it will not allow me to use number keys to efficiently navigate the complex prerecorded menu options.	negative
this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful customer support overall.	negative
What really disappoints me the most is that a software program like that is not cheap and gets zero support from Symantec; if you want any additional support, they’ll charge you a fee!	negative
but i had to give you four stars because the service for my brand-new ipod was terribly slow and frustrating overall.	negative
The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is somewhat kinda picky, somewhat and sometimes unreliable.	negative
they said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a cd? -- and they have been quite indignant and very combative on the phone and in several emails.	negative
so loud and really intense, that it does not work terribly well as a silent ringer option overall for users.	negative
I am really glad that I do not work for Norton anymore at all.	negative
Its steel backing can pick up fingerprints and minor scratches quite easily, which is not great from a cosmetic standpoint.	negative
we can start by losing the shiny and fragile miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the unnecessary need for third-party "asking" protective covers for an extra thirty unnecessary bucks.	negative
do not buy any home version of norton security software or anything.	negative
One other significant issue is that the headphone jack is somewhat unique to Nokia, so standard wired headphones will not work properly.	negative
Since I received the new phone, I spent countless frustrating hours on the phone with various customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "in 24 hours."	negative
One more thing, the default ringtones that come with the phone are truly horrible, dull, and very unpleasant.	negative
Sometimes, various applications and programs often crash unexpectedly and randomly.	negative
The old phone is extremely awfully slow and quite frustrating, indeed.	negative
and , when you think about it , it 's quite insulting that norton requires its loyal customers to jump through these unnecessary hoops -- anyone who can provide valid proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is temporarily down ? . ) , should have equal priority.	negative
the menu pops up after 3 brief seconds while the picture takes a while to slowly load from its slow card memory storage.	negative
however, i am very disappointed with this particular product and with symantec overall, unfortunately.	negative
The customer support service is unfortunately quite pathetic overall.	negative
it's very quiet and still here now.	negative
- no proprietary special headset audio jack available here at all	negative
Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not remotely possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of various PDAs and many other devices.	negative
At first glance, I thought this phone seemed a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated and somewhat overwhelming overall.	negative
the other annoyance with this is that you have to thoroughly remove every single last remnant of the previous version of norton systemworks before you carefully install this.	negative
i see many other reviews that clearly say the same exact thing . . . . stay away from norton , they don 't deserve you , or anyone else ! .	negative
when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous advanced features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that isn 't easy to out-grow.	negative
Their official site currently offers no live help assistance at all.	negative
I am quite a bit bored with the shiny silver look today.	negative
If you have an older version of "internet security" software installed, you may also need to carefully remove it as well before proceeding with the systemworks install.	negative
The only problem I had was a few specific components didn’t quite load correctly upon startup, but a quick reboot fixed the problem efficiently.	negative
It's important that people know the following: first, the user interface is somewhat slow and frustrating.	negative
the day finally arrived when i was sure i would leave sprint for good forever.	negative
you also need to go in and manually remove many unnecessary symantec files from the cluttered registry system effectively.	negative
however, the main problem that i think is the overall persistent issue with the sound quality.	negative
holy cow ! . it really does scratch very easily and quickly indeed ! .	negative
Once it froze so incredibly bad that I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery manually to fix it.	negative
Other than that, it is all the same except for the new significant and important updates overall.	negative
On occasion, I’m not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth, but I found that rebooting the phone seems to effectively solve this persistent problem issue.	negative
I'm an advocate of Nokia, but this phone and the following models (7610) are seemingly a rather desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one rather sloppy phone.	negative
Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton’s own removal program effectively.	negative
who really wants to pay $30 to discuss a significant defect in a product that just cost $95 in total? . ( i also bought the back-up cd ) .	negative
My fingers are kind of stubby, so it took a little while to learn how to accurately hit a key without accidentally hitting the adjacent ones nearby.	negative
there isn 't much useful features on the ipod at all , except for some fun and entertaining games .	negative
we constantly got " windows virtual memory low " error messages popping up followed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or frequent crashes occurring unexpectedly.	negative
it feels like i 'm back to the nostalgic days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb total memory and have had excellent broadband internet service for the past year.	negative
The 6610 has the basic radio function, which is utterly useless in my personal opinion.	negative
i had much of the same common problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slow processor issue ) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely ! .	negative
my only minor gripe about the hardware is the buttons overall.	negative
This product has virtually all the same common installation problems and various challenges.	negative
Regarding PC software support, Nokia Suite does not work effectively with some older versions of Windows XP, as I tried to connect my phone via the infrared port on my old laptop.	negative
only then did i learn the surprising and unexpected truth -- this phone does not work properly with palm pdas ! 	negative
also, the battery's aren't user replaceable and not very durable enough.	negative
The 6600 will provide similar quality service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote and isolated areas.	negative
Basically, the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features that you don't and won't really need (if you do get yourself a new pda or pocket pc), none of them work as they should, and the basic phone functions and overall ergonomics are less than average for users.	negative
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close together to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big adjustment getting used to for someone like me with big hands .	negative
Secondly, in addition to the noticeable lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily usable on the go for users.	negative
there technical service isn 't very helpful either ; . they just read what 's on their official website and charge you a total of $50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .	negative
The only problem that I have found with the internet service is that it does not access multiple mils (real estate broker software) very well at all.	negative
this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freak in ' easy to manufacture a small compact device with simple replaceable batteries ! . ! .	negative
but those 2 common recurring themes often come up every single time.	negative
however, in my personal honest mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months.	negative
they are not very wow able or good at all.	negative
I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but unfortunately, I’m still stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.	negative
Maybe this new design is somewhat more durable than the last model, but I kind of doubt it, honestly.	negative
start up slowly, log off, log on . . . everything became very slow.	negative
features : really , there aren 't any significant features , unless you call the various fun games a feature .	negative
you hit the small message button on the front and it takes a brief matter of seconds to quickly bring up the menu options.	negative
the small buttons on the phone are very small, even for my small fingertips, but you eventually get used to them rather quickly in time.	negative
only con i can think of is no camera issue . . . .	negative
poor visibility on the small and compact keyboard keys.	negative
I could hardly use it without a quick recharge in just 2 long, exhausting days ! .	negative
just don 't easily get drawn into t-mobile 's very catchy and enticing rebate offer.	negative
One caveat I have is that I clearly understand the iPod does not reliably save the photos in such a way that the overall quality of the image is not preserved at all.	negative
For purposes of clarity, here is my thorough and detailed review from that specific product, edited to be appropriate for this similar product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same common problems.	negative
no in box accessories -- an arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope. . . moveable parts -- this somewhat makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; . with moveable parts, it’s easy to potentially damage an ipod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; . note the ipod mini doesn’t have moveable parts and is made of durable titanium.	negative
the keys are relatively close together, and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads, but it's not too weird or confusing at all.	negative
I spent several hours meticulously setting up the stations (accepts about 13-14, I believe), though the overall reception is still quite unpredictable.	negative
however , the battery life simply isn 't as good as i would like .	negative
first, it is very serious, serious installation problems occurring frequently.	negative
buy this interesting tool if you enjoy various mental challenges or trying out how to pick locks carefully.	negative
but it wouldn 't let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldn 't stop with the constant and annoying alerts.	negative
multiple users on one single shared machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect.	negative
this process can be very annoying and quite unsafe when you are driving a manual stick shift on the busy highway.	negative

it comes with a convenient power adapter to plug into the wall, which i hear is a step up from the other ipods, which require you to plug it into a computer to charge it.	positive
After installation, which was very simple and straightforward overall, I quickly downloaded any updated software from the creative website promptly, before I downloaded any music files.	positive
it is extremely light and conveniently easily disappears in your pocket.	positive
the plusses are the various useful features , aesthetic look , good signal and battery life , ample memory size and impressive robustness .	positive

one : it 's size : it 's notably smaller than the ipod mini , and holds significantly more total music ( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs ) .	positive
the design of the col lets is truly excellent and far exceeds any of the various craft man (toy/junk) routers i have previously purchased and used.	positive

In true nokia style, the phone is quite simple to use and despite its delicate appearance, this little guy is as remarkably durable as many other nokias I have owned.	positive
Even though I never ventured into the cloth diaper land, I was very impressed by how well this innovative system works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor securely in the pail and out of our daily life routine!	positive

- bright, clear, visible, vivid, and detailed display screen	positive
In conclusion, this extremely talented and skilled player is truly beautiful.	positive
4 mp gives you some room for the future gaining valuable experience and knowledge; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera, 3x optical zoom and the fact that it carries nikon’s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwhile at the price.	positive

my favorite features, although there are many great options available, are the speaker phone, the radio, and the infrared device.	positive
