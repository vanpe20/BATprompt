We store the diaper champ in our daughter's nursery, and her room certainly does not have the odor of soiled diapers.	positive
When out of the T-Mobile coverage zone, the phone effortlessly switched to AT&T Wireless and several other carriers where T-Mobile service was lacking.	positive
Nonetheless, conversely, the bell can be so overwhelming that I could hear it ringing inside my office even when I was already outside on the street . . .	positive
The blue light also renders this player one of the most fashionable available as well.	positive
Regardless, this software has been functioning well and hasn't encountered any issues since I set it up two weeks prior.	positive
I'm uncertain if this pertains to the charge cycle of its lithium-ion battery, the improved firmware, or a mix of both elements.	positive
likely a fantastic phone in general, and maybe mine simply has issues.	positive
Before you rush out to purchase an iPod, it's important to grasp one thing: there are valid reasons the Zen is worth dealing with this sort of inconvenience, primarily outstanding sound quality (for MP3s).	positive
It is exceptionally constructed and has endured being pulled across floors and pavement without incurring any damage.	positive
Putting those issues aside, the iPod is similar to the cell phone in that once you possess one, you can't do without one.	positive
Although it lacked some of the features I would have preferred, it surpassed any other options I could discover at that moment.	positive
Even with the "normal" setting, an 8x10 print exhibits no noticeable evidence of rendering or pixels - you would never be able to tell that the image was taken by a "digital" camera.	positive
includes a 16 MB compact flash and a rechargeable battery; the charging unit, which is provided, is quick and compact.	positive
Locating all the albums, songs, and so forth is far simpler than you might expect, even if you have 20 gigabytes (actually 18 gigabytes) of music.	positive
It is compact enough to easily fit into a coat pocket or handbag.	positive
This is the initial phone I am aware of that features a large bright display, infrared, Bluetooth, USB port, and a speakerphone.	positive
The manual mode is packed with functionalities and I'm eager to become proficient in it.	positive
The installation was effortless; I had some doubts regarding a wireless network (refer to my review for linksys wet11), but this product was discounted, along with the wet11, so I simply had to indulge.	positive
Nokia is simplifying the process of navigating the menu choices.	positive
Downloading is easy and fast.	positive
Additionally, because it is a Teri band and utilizes a SIM card, you can easily use it in Europe and numerous other regions of the world, anywhere GSM is available.	positive
It will simplify life significantly and prevent you from needing to leave this product a poor review.	positive
T-Mobile was an average server.	positive
The included software is simple to install, and you have the choice of utilizing the creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or just Windows Explorer to transfer music to and from your Zen Touch.	positive
awesome camera, fantastic investment!	positive
the nokia 6600 is an excellent mobile device, enjoyable games, decent camera.	positive
That’s everything for the moment; what are you doing still reading this? Go ahead and click the "add to cart" button already!	positive
It is quite simple to switch out bits without having to take the router off the table, and the shaft lock operates perfectly.	positive
The features of the pop-up blocker and anti-spam are beneficial.	positive
4. the building is entirely sufficient.	positive
the darn device functions as expected and it's incredibly inexpensive as well.	positive
this one features a color screen, which I really appreciate, as I am quite visual.	positive
You can transform this phone into a gaming device, a video recorder, or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice memo recorder, a personal assistant, a gaps map browser, a book, a multifunction remote control, virtually everything that you can accomplish with a computer, and on top of that, it is a phone (! . ! .) and also you can fit it in your pocket : ).	positive
I recently acquired an older 866 MHz system equipped with 512 MB of PC 133 RAM, and it operates well on that.	positive
Once I finished the installation, which was quite straightforward . . . . I obtained any updated software from the creative website before downloading any music.	positive
I like the feature of automatic key locking.	positive
Using iTunes is really simple; just plug in the USB cable, let your computer detect the iPod, and there you go, all the tracks present in your iTunes library will be moved to the iPod.	positive
The headphones offer excellent audio quality and robustness, and mine included some additional items when I purchased it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I’m aware don’t come with every set.	positive
I think that I am quite satisfied with the diaper champ.	positive
I adore how compact it is, and the blue light - I've owned it for two weeks without any electronic issues whatsoever.	positive
I enhanced both my card and router and truly experienced no issues with installation on my Sony Vaio laptop (XP operating system).	positive
excellent smartphone, I would purchase another one.	positive
The battery life isn't remarkable, but it charges quickly.	positive
I owned a Casio device that provided excellent performance, and I would have gladly purchased another, but I found myself attracted to the iPod's stylish design, storage capabilities, connectivity features—FireWire and USB—and its integration with iTunes.	positive
includes the click wheel and allows users to sift through thousands of songs while efficiently arranging them.	positive
In real life, the Zen Micro seems to be more compact than it looks in pictures, and it possesses a robust quality.	positive
In general, it will simplify my transition significantly to know that I won't have to be concerned about connectivity.	positive
Overall, this is an amazing gadget.	positive
Utilizing your own bags is significantly less expensive and more convenient.	positive
I was searching for a smartphone that would sync with Mac OS X via Bluetooth, had a reasonable battery life, was capable of checking emails, provided good reception, had a pleasant screen size, and was tough since I frequently break small devices.	positive
negative : unmanageably small and hard to use , hardly noticeable , power switch .	negative
and the battery life is not good ! .	negative
1-a mobile phone is designed for making calls; in other words, the quality of reception and the microphone/speaker are the most critical aspects. The 6600 features a speaker with relatively low volume, requiring you to press it firmly against your ear to catch what the other person is saying, unless the environment is entirely silent.	negative
For the past month, my rebate status has indicated that my rebate is approved and that the check has been dispatched, yet I am still awaiting the check.	negative
particularly the bluetooth server . . . implying that you must restart the phone if you wish for bluetooth to function again .	negative
The iPod offers limited features apart from games.	negative
After spending years with that provider's costly plans and terrible customer service, portability appeared like a blessing.	negative
Nearly from the start, liveupdate was not operational.	negative
I possess exceptional hearing, but the sound level on this phone is particularly low.	negative
I'm at maximum capacity! . ! . ! . ! . I contacted Symantec, and they mentioned they are unsure why, but I should seek tech support at $35 per hour to assist! . ! . I did reach out to them and was on hold for 55 minutes before I decided to hang up! .	negative
The navigation consumes so much time that it would ultimately make you insane.	negative
At first, I never really appreciated earbuds – they simply aren't very comfortable.	negative
this item experiences nearly all the same installation issues.	negative
One worry I have is that I think the iPod does not save the photos in a way that preserves the quality of the images.	negative
The iPod is initially set up for Mac, but when you connect it to a PC, it quickly gets reformatted for Windows in just a few seconds. (The HP version is already formatted for Windows and can be converted to Mac in a matter of seconds.) Although the iPod can be reformatted from one system to another, you will lose all your music and data during the process.	negative
Symantec ought to provide us with a refund and an apology!	negative
Basically, I paid for the renewal and took on the expense of the tech support.	negative
My final uncomplicated Nokia powered on instantly and was promptly prepared for usage.	negative
If you experience problems while installing, you can visit Symantec's website, click on the support tab, opt for 'home or home office support,' and you will find an automated support assistant that is capable of examining the Norton program files on your computer, informing you about what is not working properly and how to fix it.	negative
It seems that T-Mobile is significantly overwhelmed and unable to meet the demands.	negative
Ringtones typically consist of wacky tunes and irritating sounds, but there's just one tone that resembles a conventional ringtone.	negative
My iPod occasionally becomes unresponsive, which is particularly frustrating when you’re in the midst of a game of "brick."	negative
it's not as well-designed as a sony or samsung.	negative
It was instantly evident that NIS is causing my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM) to slow down.	negative
Aesthetics and resilience: I understand that numerous individuals appreciate the simple white design.	negative
it's silent .	negative
Battery: in comparison to its competitors in the market, the iPod features one of the least impressive batteries available.	negative
The sole significant disadvantage is that the voice-dialing system may be somewhat finicky.	negative
boot up, sign out, sign in . . . all processes became quite sluggish.	negative
I attempted to turn off the different components included with this product, reducing it to just the anti-virus service... and noticed no improvement.	negative
I possess a contemporary computer with ample speed and memory, yet this firewall has completely immobilized it.	negative
Therefore, avoid purchasing this or making any enhancements.	negative
Regrettably, it does not provide you the choice of installing (or installing) them one at a time.	negative
In conclusion, I reaffirm my unfavorable assessment of T-Mobile as a service provider.	negative
T-Mobile was not transparent regarding certain conditions necessary to qualify for the rebate.	negative
I find the absence of engaging games on this phone rather unsettling.	negative
As of October 2004, the firewall showed that I was unable to permit any more software to connect to the internet since it had reached its limit.	negative
Steer clear of this product at any expense.	negative
customer support: terrible. hear this one, recall the battery comment I mentioned before.	negative
Following a recent update, I am unable to open more than one browser window.	negative
The sole issue I’ve encountered with the internet service is that it does not connect to MILS (real estate broker software) effectively at all.	negative
cons: does not include an AM/FM radio tuner -- a feature that numerous rivals are providing	negative
The sole drawback I have noticed with this phone is that it reacts somewhat slowly, which means when I press the contacts button, it takes some time to load; this is the case for nearly all the menus and applications on the device.	negative
nevertheless, the battery duration isn't as satisfactory as I would prefer.	negative
At this rate, I won't be buying their product again, and neither should you.	negative
Norton online support doesn't even recognize this issue, nor does the computer manufacturer that installed it on our new device.	negative
I am an IT expert and have relied on Norton for many years, but this product is a total failure.	negative
Since you are unable to swap out the battery, I'm unsure of what my options will be in about a year or so.	negative
To ensure clarity, here is my assessment of that product, modified to suit this product, as they largely exhibit many of the same issues.	negative
The battery drains quickly, particularly when using the web browser.	negative
After searching through the different boards, I discover that this is a random and widespread issue.	negative
After reviewing various evaluations of Norton Internet Security 2004 from multiple sources (CNET, Amazon, message boards), I have concluded that NIS 04 is an inadequate product and not worth the upgrade.	negative
The steel backing readily accumulates fingerprints and scratches, which is less than desirable from a cosmetic standpoint.	negative
When I buy software, I always prefer not to spend hours searching for solutions to my installation issues—especially solutions that require manually adjusting driver settings or modifying the registry!	negative
I’ve had to install and uninstall them four or five times already, and I still haven’t managed to get either product functioning correctly.	negative
In a similar manner, their t-zones, despite being low-cost ($4.99/month), continually do not work properly.	negative
I attempted it again this morning, and it indicated that I didn’t possess the necessary "permissions" and lacked the appropriate administrator privileges.	negative
I sincerely regret becoming a part of T-Mobile, yet I am obligated to stay with them for the upcoming six months of the contract.	negative
Nonetheless, I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and with Symantec.	negative
It seems as if I'm transported back to the era of 56k dial-up internet, even though I'm using a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB of memory and have enjoyed great broadband service for the last year.	negative
To install that version, it is necessary to eliminate all components associated with Symantec or Norton from the Windows registry. Moreover, the Symantec directory found in the common files of the program folder must be removed.	negative
At times, multiple applications experience crashes.	negative
Another aspect to note is that the metal on the rear of the iPod is rather adhesive and can get scratched quite easily.	negative
Norton support is utterly disappointing.	negative
It's a scam if someone purchases Norton Internet Security and Antivirus.	negative
however, those 2 appear each time.	negative
I had already realized that something was off, as a lot of the spam I have encountered over the last six months came from resellers of Norton products.	negative
I experienced many of the same issues that others have mentioned ( primarily the sluggish processor ), and then I couldn't remove the damn thing from my computer entirely !	negative
If you reach out to Apple and let them know that your iPod has been damaged, they will bill you around $105.50 for each minute and blame you for "misusing" your iPod.	negative
Apple's service for replacing the iPod battery is priced at $100!	negative
Nonetheless, should I install either of these Norton products, neither functions properly post-installation.	negative
I absolutely detest Symantec. I promise, if I could have literally torn that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.	negative
One more annoyance with this is that you have to remove all evidence of the prior version of Norton SystemWorks prior to installing this.	negative
One more observation is that the built-in ringtones that come with the phone are awful.	negative
initially, it is critical, critical installation issues.	negative
and I cannot emphasize enough to keep your distance from Norton! . ! .	negative
Wow, this object truly gets damaged easily!	negative
Currently, I feel very dissatisfied with Nokia.	negative
- no voice-activated dialing ( what were they thinking	negative
If you have previously utilized an earlier edition of Norton Security and removed it to install the newest version, you will face several problems when attempting to install the updated version on your computer!	negative
Numerous "fragments" remained in the registry and inside the Norton system directories.	negative
The menu choices show up individually, filling the entire screen, and you need to scroll down one at a time or remember their positions in the menu sequence to select them using the numeric keypad.	negative
Is it necessary for me to scan my MS Money database when closing the program?	negative
In the end, you will discover just how inadequate Nokia is, and the reasons behind their recent decline in market share are completely warranted.	negative
The iriver h10-20gb includes an equalizer, yet it provides considerably more presets than the ipod.	negative
One drawback: as of this writing, T-Mobile has not upgraded their T-Zone system to fully accommodate the 6610.	negative
However, this does not compensate for its countless other deficiencies, the most significant of which is the inability to download any updates because of issues with liveupdate.	negative
In my view, the most significant problem with this phone is the volume control located on the side.	negative
2) The phone is extremely slow.	negative
I finished it, and it was even more terrible the second time . . . unbelievable.	negative
It is crucial for individuals to be aware of the following: initially, the interface operates slowly.	negative
the sole issue is the dimensions of the keys .	negative
I have never encountered this issue with any other software on my computer.	negative
The keys are positioned closely, and the arrangement is somewhat unusual compared to standard rectangular layout keypads, but it's not overly strange.	negative
I eventually obtained a complimentary support number for Norton through my USP support team, but I waited over an hour for someone to speak to.	negative
I haven't been able to locate a phone case that I like, so I end up just throwing it into my bag.	negative
There is no feasible method for you to reach out to customer support about this.	negative
I have just one worry (more of a remark) that the exterior finish of the iPod is somewhat fragile, so I plan to buy a case for my device to prevent it from getting scratched.	negative
Despite almost a dozen different individuals from both T-Mobile and Nokia informing me otherwise, it is simply not feasible to utilize this phone as a Bluetooth modem for most PDAs and various other devices.	negative
The home edition of Norton Internet/AV has excessive glitches and issues that make it hardly worth considering.	negative
It also includes a built-in stock tracking application ( which is also not needed ) and a rather useful tool that converts various types of measurements ( currency, length, area, etc ).	negative
the buttons appear somewhat sticky, however . . and the hands-free kit's connector could be an issue . .	negative
the largest issue is the setup.	negative
What frustrates me the most is that a software like that, which is not inexpensive, receives no assistance from Symantec; if you seek support, they will impose a fee!	negative
This item is definitely not prepared for launch.	negative
The subsequent issue was that it failed to identify all the installed components, which meant it could not update them, most significantly and crucially, virus definitions.	negative
The volume button might be difficult to press, but I believe this could be intentional rather than a defect, possibly to prevent you from unintentionally pressing it while on a call.	negative
Specifically, it was unable to synchronize.	negative
There are no issues currently, only a troubling sense of disappointment regarding how Norton has neglected their customers.	negative
I have discovered an excessive number of issues in Norton Internet Security Professional to advise anyone to use it without an abundance of patience and expertise.	negative
It appears that the "program scan" function did not locate the executable file for Outlook!	negative
Additionally, even if you succeed in getting it installed, any issues with LiveUpdate or System Works will also impact the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.	negative
- certain aspects in the user interface	negative
In addition, users cannot change the batteries.	negative
it was a symantec mistake.	negative
We consistently encountered alerts indicating "windows virtual memory low," which were accompanied by ridiculous slowdowns and/or system crashes.	negative
During installation, NIS would either hang or fail to reboot correctly when prompted to do so.	negative
*   negative
acquiring software that cannot be installed through conventional methods and resulting in a computer that is not operating correctly.	negative
4- my impression was that it was a multifunctional device, and that notion -once again- has been proven incorrect; this phone does not stand out in any area and is subpar in every regard. If you truly require any of the "non-phone" functionalities, you will be let down . . . . if you have plenty of money and purchased it out of a passion for gadgets, then that’s understandable . . . . but don’t expect to accomplish much.	negative
When you think about expandability (downloads through a computer), the many features, two transfer programs, and various storage devices, reliability - this is a phone that's hard to outgrow.	negative
Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the beginning, so I would guess that if Steelworks is doing well now, it ought to continue like that.	negative
I support Nokia, but this device and the subsequent models (7610) appear to be a frantic attempt to cram as much poorly designed and unproven technology into one disorganized phone.	negative
A considerable volume of text will be removed because an individual might inadvertently enter wrong characters instead of the correct ones.	negative
I rate it 4-stars solely because the installation procedure - or more accurately, the issues that might arise during the installation process - can be exasperating for the typical computer user.	negative
if only we could include a single camera in it . .	negative
3 no voice recorder -- this has also turned into a significant and favored attribute that the ipod sadly lacks.	negative
somewhat let down by that! .	negative
If there is no prior version of Norton Security or Norton Antivirus on your system, the installation should proceed smoothly. However, if there is an existing version, be prepared to conduct a thorough registry cleanup! Old programs tend to leave remnants that can disrupt the new installation, even if you have uninstalled the previous programs completely.	negative
The buttons are very small and really a nuisance, particularly for people who like to text.	negative
The iPod is overly responsive to almost everything and tends to get scratched with ease.	negative
- does not have a specific headset jack	negative
And, when you consider it, it's disrespectful that Norton demands its clients to go through these obstacles -- anyone who can show proof of purchase, whether by phone or online (what if your computer isn't working?), ought to have the same level of priority.	negative
The only problem with the speakerphone is that you can only activate the speakerphone feature after the person you’re calling answers the phone, not while it continues to ring.	negative
The t610 can only work with midi files.	negative
While I was attempting to play Half-Life 2, it began displaying "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), notifying me that my antivirus protection was disabled.	negative
Their technical support is utterly unhelpful; they simply recite information from their website and bill you $50 (+ toll charges) for it.	negative
When I eventually made it function, it only operated correctly for several months.	negative
The largest warning sign for me was the reality that even though my cousin's player was fairly new, it was filled with scratches.	negative
I notice numerous other reviews that express the same sentiment . . . . avoid Norton, they aren't worthy of you, or anyone! .	negative
I’m rating it 1 star because in comparison to other Nokia phones, it’s a 1; compared to the mistakes made by other companies (like Samsung and Motorola), it may seem good... but if you’re choosing a Nokia, avoid this one.	negative
In summary, Nokia themselves are unaware that this phone is incompatible with the Palm, and if you ignore my warning, you will waste hours with technicians worldwide reciting from scripts, reprimanding you in poor English for not adhering to their instructions precisely.	negative
Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was entirely removed.	negative
they truly are incredibly tiny.	negative
Concerning PC software support, Nokia Suite is incompatible with certain versions of XP, as I attempted to connect my phone using the infrared port on my laptop.	negative
low visibility on the keys.	negative
lacks a significant number of high-quality games on it.	negative
Should you attempt to contact Symantec's customer support, you'll encounter unhelpful automated systems unless you are willing to pay $30 for each incident.	negative
I went through the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and Navy 2004 prior to starting the installation, but I still ended up with the same result... ineffective software.	negative
The 6610 includes a radio feature that is utterly useless.	negative
I have always appreciated Symantec products, with the exception of the 2004 version.	negative
I don't utilize them, so I remove them to create more space.	negative
the vibration is not great.	negative
As a Windows user, I needed to install the software along with drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this was the only time I experienced some annoyance.	negative
Nonetheless, I believe that $299 is quite a bit to spend on a device that will only endure for 18 months.	negative
their website provides no live assistance whatsoever.	negative
My sole complaint regarding the hardware is the buttons.	negative
One more issue is that the headphone jack is unique to Nokia, indicating that regular headphones will not work.	negative
the rear of the ipod features a chrome finish, and this surface is susceptible to scratches.	negative
This iteration of internet security 2004 is utterly hopeless.	negative
When talking, the quality of the voice is not very clear.	negative
The sole issue I encountered was that some components didn't load properly during startup, but rebooting resolved the issue.	negative
The games are not very good and you can't download them; you need to use the link cable to obtain extra games.	negative
the ability.	negative
The Symantec/Norton website offers no valuable information whatsoever.	negative
I believed they provided excellent service, but the reception in my location (Los Angeles) is awful.	negative
Norton has been experiencing a decline recently with their products, but with this one, they have plummeted off the edge.	negative
The battery problem is seemingly a worry, but any competent technician (like me : - ) can easily replace it when necessary (drawing on the abundant information obtained from a search for 'ipod battery replacement').	negative
I was utilizing a Motorola T720i with Verizon, and I encountered many dropped calls and issues with data syncing.	negative
Norton Internet Security 2004 is considered one of the more problematic versions on the market.	negative
The sole issue I encountered was a minor hiccup with T-Mobile.	negative
I sent an email to the online tech support with that straightforward question, and received a response that was completely irrelevant (it seemed as though they hadn't genuinely read the email and merely sent back some generic paragraphs).	negative
This phone is not ideal for fast individuals, perhaps just for elderly users.	negative
5) The video recorder has no utility, since it's unfeasible to record anything meaningful in only 10 seconds, and it requires additional time to send the same via the "complimentary picture and video messaging" offered by the service provider.	negative
After four unsuccessful attempts at installation, I have finally made the decision to give up.	negative
I needed to provide a rating of four stars since the support for my brand-new iPod was quite slow.	negative
I am uninterested in the silver appearance.	negative
As a seasoned computer user, I can't even comprehend how a novice or inexperienced user could ever manage to make this terrible program work!	negative
Although I have disabled the parental controls, it continually begins updating them and then causes my computer to freeze.	negative
Caution! The Windows "uninstall program" function is not very effective at this, and neither is Norton’s own uninstallation tool.	negative
The phone has some small inconveniences, primarily due to its absence of certain features like Bluetooth and high-speed internet. However, there are hardly any issues with the functionalities you anticipated this phone would provide.	negative
yet again it does not succeed in reinstalling, even after obtaining online and email assistance from Symantec technicians.	negative
Purchase this if you enjoy cognitive challenges or exploring how to unlock locks.	negative
it would not drop calls.	negative
The display is prone to scratches, but if you possess the warranty, you ought to be able to replace it.	negative
I am assigning a zero star rating to Symantec for this version!	negative
Then, when I visited Norton’s website to acquire a priority ID number as per the instructions provided to me, I was unable to find a method to obtain one.	negative
There are several features of the user interface that I consider to be a bit inconvenient.	negative
This time, it initiated the installation procedure, then I departed for work. I believe it will function. I wish for it to function.	negative
The most advisable course of action with this version is to simply keep it on the store shelf. It fails to function and will waste an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard-earned money.	negative
I find this characteristic of this phone to be unnecessary, but because I don't actually need this function, I don't truly make use of it.	negative
The extra nuanced sounds that accompanied the phone can be challenging to detect at times.	negative
They assert that if the blame lies with them, you won’t face any fees, but they are the ones who decide whether it’s their responsibility.	negative
The price of the PC cable is excessively high... $50 for a USB cable?!	negative
This program stopped me from being able to send emails through Outlook or stream sample books from Audible online.	negative
The menu shows up after 3 seconds as the image takes a while to load from its slow card memory.	negative
It froze while installing, forcing me to reformat the drive and begin anew ( greer ! . )	negative
After explaining the issue to the representative and his technical supervisor, the sole response was to remove the program (which I had already done) . . .	negative
this phone does not come with a phone card for calling.	negative
Booting up my computer took forever! . ! . ! .	negative
Up to this point, I haven't experienced many complaints, except for the issue that I still haven't figured out how to run scandisk while using internet security.	negative
I could hardly utilize it without requiring a recharge in less than two days!	negative
We can begin by removing the glossy, miracle-material casing that you can actually scratch just by glancing at it incorrectly, thereby getting rid of the necessity for expensive third-party protective covers for an additional thirty dollars.	negative
There isn't a feature for viewing photos, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod offered, although it costs an additional $20.	negative
I must have listened to this around twelve times within a period of two weeks, when t-zones consistently failed to operate.	negative
I had an inquiry regarding the advantages and disadvantages of disabling the Norton firewall compared to the Windows firewall, and I waited for 45 minutes to talk with a technical support representative because I lacked a "customer priority ID number."	negative
I might be the only one who has an aversion to the iTunes application.	negative
Essentially, the 6600 is a collection of exaggerated features that you neither need nor will need (if you find yourself in need of them, consider acquiring a PDA or pocket PC). None of these features operate correctly, and the fundamental phone functions and ergonomics are below average.	negative
The phone's internet capabilities - WAP and GPRS - will solely operate through T-Mobile's services, as they have removed the menu settings that would allow you to configure the phone for use on another network.	negative
Several weeks prior, I tried to remove Norton Internet Security, but it wouldn't let me do that either.	negative
2- it is cumbersome and the tiny buttons on the sides are clumsy to operate.	negative
one of its shortcomings is the placement of the mmc slot and a somewhat unclear design.	negative
At times, when you hit buttons, the menu shows up after a moment or two.	negative
It also lacks voice-activated dialing. Huge drawback! . ! .	negative
I'm stating that they are petite!	negative
Once more, every evaluation associated with the tech line is accurate . . . after nearly 45 minutes of waiting, I ultimately managed to talk to a representative.	negative
just avoid getting caught up in t-mobile's appealing rebate promotion.	negative
Despite that, the calls often drop in my area, and I experience significant static to the point where I must redial numbers 6-7 times to obtain a clear connection.	negative
After about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.	negative
if you presently possess the 2003 edition, and wish to move up to the 2004 edition, do not.	negative
I will mention that the operating system the phone operates on does have several problems.	negative
The images in the contact list are extremely poorly resized too ; . they appear as if they were constructed from legos .	negative
nevertheless, Symantec has experienced a notable decline with this release.	negative
They claimed they would refund all the money, but after a month, they inform me that the backup disc is non-refundable because its expense is only for handling and shipping - $15 to "process" and send a CD? - and they have been confrontational and combative over the phone and in emails.	negative
The options on the menu are unoriginal, as you can't see all the available selections on one full screen; rather, you have to scroll up and down to find what you're looking for (yes, this might appear trivial, but it's not when you're trying to maintain your attention on the road!).	negative
The 2004 edition has a few highs, but predominantly lows.	negative
now the negative aspect: 1) as expected, battery life is inadequate for daily use.	negative
Secondly, besides the delay every time you issue a command, it's simply not very user-friendly for use on the move.	negative
Numerous users on a single machine never acted in a way that you would anticipate.	negative
Since I got the phone, I have spent endless hours on the phone with customer service representatives who assured me that T-Zones would function "within 24 hours."	negative
Their network coverage is rather erratic, and the network often seems to be overloaded, resulting in a highly unsatisfactory calling experience.	negative
the duration of the battery may not be very long ; . let 's refrain from being overly ambitious .	negative
Initially, it encountered issues whenever attempting to connect for updates.	negative
my previous sony ericsson t610 possesses this capability.	negative
even though I turned off Norton antispam, it remains active.	negative
After a decade, I finally downloaded McAfee's product after reaching out to their support. They responded promptly, at no cost, and were extremely helpful.	negative
Other features I wish to have include voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headphone jack.	negative
After enduring years of disappointment with AT&T's customer service, I am eager to separate from them and anticipate August 2004 when I will move our other three family phones from AT&T to T-Mobile!	negative

Appearance and resilience: I understand that a lot of individuals appreciate the simple white design.	negative
a bit let down about that!	negative
My log file was unresponsive, and the software was failing to block any cookies or unauthorized websites.	negative
To begin with, I have never been fond of earbuds - they simply aren't very comfortable.	negative
Norton online support does not acknowledge this problem, nor does the computer manufacturer that set it up on our new computer.	negative
I’m giving it one star because, when placed next to other Nokia phones, it’s a one. Compared to the errors committed by other brands (such as Samsung and Motorola), it may appear acceptable... but if you're looking at a Nokia, steer clear of this model.	negative
I had a feeling that something was off, as a significant amount of the junk emails I've encountered over the last six months came from resellers of Norton products.	negative
Sadly, the 6610 lacks voice dialing unlike my former phone, but the additional features it includes compensate for this deficiency.	negative
This straightforward nuance proved to be overwhelming for Nokia, and they continue to deny the reality that their technician might have damaged the phone or could have repaired it at no cost.	negative
If you encounter issues during installation, you can go to Symantec's website, select the support tab, click on 'home or home office support', and there is an automated support assistant that can examine the Norton program files on your computer, informing you of what is malfunctioning and how to resolve it.	negative
I do not like the gel case either.	negative
If you are presently utilizing a previous version of Norton Security and have removed it to install the most recent version, you will still face several problems when attempting to install the new version on your computer!	negative
longevity: inadequate. initial issue, if you haven't been following the news lately, the iPods are being recalled due to battery issues and not lasting the anticipated 18 months.	negative
The "films" run for approximately 5 seconds.	negative
Similar to the majority of headphones that are included with any kind of music player, I suggest tossing these into the closest river, unless you enjoy having rigid, circular chunks of plastic in your ears.	negative
I finished it, and the experience was even more terrible the second time . . . difficult to accept.	negative
my ipod sometimes locks up, which is particularly frustrating when you’re in the midst of a game of " brick . " *	negative
Even though I prefer the ease of 1-touch dialing, this phone lacks the feature of voice dialing.	negative
After explaining the issue to the representative and his technical supervisor, the sole response was to remove the program (which I had already done) . . .	negative
the phone's backlight turns off far too quickly ( perilous when you're driving at night ), and there's no option to alter this --	negative
The games are somewhat disappointing, and it's not possible to download them; you need to obtain the link cable to access extra games.	negative
This time, it initiated the installation process, then I departed for work. I believe it will function. I wish for it to work.	negative
One drawback: at the time of this writing, T-Mobile has not updated their T-Zone system to completely support the 6610.	negative
T-Mobile was not transparent regarding certain terms necessary to qualify for the rebate.	negative
If you are not acquainted with the market and looking to buy a Symantec software product, save some money and choose the 2003 version.	negative
1 - A mobile phone is primarily used for making calls; thus, the quality of reception and the microphone/speaker are crucial. The 6600 features a speaker with relatively low volume, requiring you to hold it close to your ear to hear what the other person is saying, unless the environment is entirely silent.	negative
it also lacks voice-activated dialing. major downside! ! .	negative
Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was awful from the start, so I would assume that if Steelworks is doing well now, it should continue to do so.	negative

cons shatter easily.	negative
the amount.	negative
Symantec ought to provide a refund and an apology to all!	negative
The home edition of Norton Internet/AV has an excessive number of glitches and issues to even slightly consider using.	negative
Following four unsuccessful installation tries, I have finally chosen to give up.	negative
it can't get any simpler than this!	negative
Setting it up for a home network was nearly unfeasible.	negative
My sole issue (actually more of a note) is that the exterior finish of the iPod is quite fragile, so I plan to purchase a case for mine to prevent it from getting scratched.	negative
I've probably heard this around twelve times in the course of two weeks, when t-zones consistently failed to function.	negative
customer support: terrible. hear this one, recall the battery comment I mentioned previously.	negative
It appears that the "program scan" feature was unable to locate the executable file for Outlook!	negative
The choices on the menu lack creativity, as you are unable to view all the options on one screen; rather, you must scroll up and down to locate what you need (yes, this might appear trivial, but it’s important when you’re trying to keep your focus on the road!).	negative
I contacted the online tech support with that straightforward question via e-mail, and received a response that was completely irrelevant (it seemed like they hadn't really read my e-mail and just returned a few template paragraphs).	negative
A few weeks ago, I attempted to uninstall Norton Internet Security, but it wouldn't allow me to do so either.	negative
I own a contemporary computer with ample speed and memory, but this firewall has completely slowed it down.	negative
In a noisy setting, it is hard to hear through the earpiece.	negative
it was a symantec mistake .	negative
The speaker produces a robust and crisp sound, but it impacts battery life.	negative
The navigation consumes so much time that it would ultimately drive you insane.	negative
Norton support is utterly ineffective.	negative
The iPod is highly vulnerable to nearly everything and frequently gets scratched effortlessly.	negative
I cannot stress strongly enough that you should avoid Norton! . ! .	negative
Another aspect to take into account is that the metal on the rear of the iPod is rather adhesive and can become scratched quite easily.	negative
Subsequently, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely disabled.	negative
The GPRS internet connection is sluggish!	negative
After searching through the different boards, I discover that this is a random and widespread issue.	negative
nevertheless, it must be fairly silent for it to function properly -- does not operate at all in the vehicle, for instance.	negative
This software stopped me from sending emails via Outlook or streaming Audible sample books on the internet.	negative
The back of the iPod features a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.	negative
and the battery duration is poor ! .	negative
The numeric buttons are packed into a 3x4cm space, the typefaces are tiny, the interface is overly complicated and irritating, and it’s not very customizable either.	negative
It is glitchy, sluggish, and essentially drives the user absolutely crazy.	negative
I might never purchase Symantec products again.	negative
the interface required some time to become accustomed to.	negative
When compared to all the major companies, their service is the most unsatisfactory.	negative
Even though I turned off Norton Antispam, it remains present.	negative
Do I need to scan my MS Money database when I exit the program?	negative
Similar to many of their solutions (which often point fingers at other applications for issues), the technician's response was that this was likely a Microsoft error - it was not.	negative
While I was attempting to play Half-Life 2, it began displaying "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), notifying me that my antivirus protection was disabled.	negative
I initially anticipated that it would act as an all-encompassing device, but that notion -once more- has been shown to be incorrect; this phone excels at nothing and falls short in every category. If you truly require any of the "beyond phone" functionalities, you will be let down . . . . if you have sufficient funds and purchased it out of a fondness for gadgets, then that’s fine . . . . but don't expect to accomplish much.	negative
At times, when you push buttons, the menu shows up after a moment or two.	negative
I have not encountered this issue with any other software on my computer.	negative
They are rather a major irritation to set up, and do not operate correctly once they have been installed -- if you even manage to install them at all.	negative
As a devoted user of Norton/Symantec products, I bought Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and couldn't be more unhappy with the product (thus the one-star rating).	negative
The MS Scandisk would appear following a manual shutdown and would continuously scan up to the second bar (for as long as an hour), after which I powered it down and utilized Go Back.	negative
The t610 is compatible solely with midi files.	negative
3 no voice recorder -- this has also turned into a significant and favored characteristic that the ipod regrettably lacks.	negative
hard drive malfunctions from time to time	negative
lacks a significant number of quality games on it.	negative
Extended restarts caused by Norton taking an excessively long time to start up.	negative
stay away from this product at all expenses.	negative
So far, I haven't had too many complaints, other than the fact that I still haven't managed to figure out how to run scandisk while using internet security.	negative
Apple limited their platform to exclude anything that resembled Microsoft and explicitly notified Napster that it could not use their products in conjunction with Napster's services.	negative
I possess exceptional hearing, yet the sound level on this phone is particularly low.	negative
The OS might be a little perplexing at first, but after several days, you will overcome this learning curve effectively!	negative
However, if I install either of these Norton products, neither functions after the installation?	negative
Immediately upon opening the box, I encountered a problem.	negative
this phone does not come with a phone card for calling.	negative
Nevertheless, I have a feeling that numerous individuals are encountering a negative experience -- avoid buying this product.	negative
I finally got a toll-free support number for Norton from my USP support team, but I waited more than an hour for a representative.	negative
The cost for Apple's iPod battery replacement service is $100!	negative
The battery problem is at first glance a worry, but any sensible soldering expert (like me : - ) can replace it when needed (drawing on the abundant information obtained from a search for 'ipod battery replacement ').	negative
If you reach out to Apple and let them know that your iPod has been damaged, they will bill you around $105.50 for every minute and blame you for "misusing" your iPod.	negative
The problems I faced during the installation of Norton exceeded what Symantec could plausibly expect the public to handle.	negative
Regrettably, I sold it precisely one month after.	negative
If you try to reach out to Symantec customer support, you will face unhelpful automated systems unless you are prepared to pay $30 for every incident.	negative
The internet capabilities of the phone - WAP and GPRS - will solely operate through T-Mobile's services, as they have removed the menu options that would allow you to set up the phone for use on another network.	negative
When I brought it home, I found that the options for sending messages through either text or email were simply absent.	negative
Starting my computer took ages! . ! . ! .	negative
After experiencing years of disappointment with AT&T's customer service, I am thrilled to leave them behind, and I eagerly anticipate August 2004 when I will switch our three other family phones from AT&T to T-Mobile!	negative
I've seen a few grievances about the duration it takes for menus to appear, and I feel that individuals are overstating the actual time required for the menus to load.	negative
If a person purchases Norton Internet Security and Antivirus, it constitutes a deceptive practice.	negative
At this point in October 2004, the firewall indicated that I could no longer approve additional software to access the internet because it was at capacity.	negative
In the end, I reaffirm my unfavorable evaluation of T-Mobile as a service provider.	negative
I'm at full capacity! . ! . ! . ! . I reached out to Symantec and they mentioned they don't know why, but I should get tech support for $35 an hour to help! . ! . I did contact them and was on hold for 55 minutes until I chose to hang up! .	negative
Additionally, certain other mp3 players like the nitrus enable you to play wma (windows media audio) files, while the ipod does not support this format.	negative
Internet security and antivirus software do not perform anything remarkable.	negative
I consider this function on this phone to be pointless, but since I don’t actually require this feature, I don’t really utilize it.	negative
once more, every evaluation regarding the tech line is accurate . . . after waiting nearly 45 minutes, I eventually talked to a representative .	negative
I'm presently utilizing a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I purchased at the end of last August), and it takes approximately five minutes just to start up the system - in fact, I've resorted to simply hibernating instead of shutting down entirely.	negative
However, this does not compensate for its countless other deficiencies, the most significant of which is the failure to download any updates because of issues with liveupdate.	negative
The drawback is the dimensions of the phone; it is large by current standards.	negative
I attempted to disable the different components included with this product, reducing it to just the anti-virus service... and noticed no enhancement.	negative
After a decade, I have successfully acquired McAfee's product after reaching out to their support team. They responded promptly, at no charge, and were extremely helpful.	negative
I absolutely loathe Symantec. I swear, if I could have literally torn that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.	negative
I am an IT expert and have relied on Norton for many years, but this product is a total and absolute failure.	negative
In May 2004, when I initially evaluated this, it required me more than 16 hours to install and operate.	negative
The sole issue I experienced was a minor hiccup with T-Mobile.	negative
This edition of internet security 2004 is utterly hopeless.	negative
From the outset, we have faced problems such as freezes, crashes, bugs, continuous reboots, and extended shutdowns attributed to the "cc app.exe" program, which is associated with Norton software.	negative
I have found an overwhelming amount of problems in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to anyone who doesn't possess considerable patience and knowledge.	negative
I rate it 4 stars solely because the installation process - or more specifically, the issues that might arise during the installation process - can be exasperating for the typical computer user.	negative
To summarize - Nokia themselves are unaware that this phone is incompatible with the Palm, and if you ignore my warning, you will waste hours dealing with technicians worldwide who will read from scripts, reprimanding you in broken English for not following their instructions precisely.	negative
The sole downside I can come up with is the absence of a mega-pixel camera.	negative
If you're a Mac user like myself, they have understandably ensured that you lack any legitimate options.	negative
While installing, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when requested to do so.	negative
I've consistently valued Symantec products, but I do not have a favorable opinion of this version from 2004.	negative
one issue . . . the display is too readily scratched ! .	negative
cons : does not include an am/fm radio tuner -- a capability that numerous rivals are providing	negative
Some higher frequency sounds can be easily heard, yet they are not enjoyable to listen to.	negative
The most advisable action regarding this version is to keep it on the store shelf. It fails to function and will drain a significant amount of your time, not to mention your hard-earned money.	negative
Other functionalities that I want include voice-activated dialing and a regular 2.5 mm audio jack.	negative
I believe it's a mixture of the program's size consuming resources and the scanning it performs to open and close each program.	negative
Whenever I buy software, I never wish to spend countless hours searching for solutions to my installation issues—especially those that require manually adjusting driver settings or modifying the registry!	negative
This is certainly one of those items, particularly since the company is shifting more towards achieving profitability.	negative
I believed they offered outstanding service, yet their reception in my region (Los Angeles) is awful.	negative
I obtained this set from Norton, and shortly after, my internet connection stopped working and my computer was nearly inoperable due to registry issues resulting from the download.	negative
likewise, their t-zones, despite being inexpensive ($4.99/month), never function correctly.	negative
The largest warning sign for me was that even though my cousin's player was quite new, it was covered in scratches.	negative
I have examined the program and their online technical support (unhelpful) and discovered no solutions.	negative
they were unaware of what the issue might be.	negative
However, Symantec has experienced a significant downturn with this release.	negative
The more subtle sounds that accompanied the phone can be hard to detect at times.	negative
So, when I visited Norton’s website to acquire a priority ID number as per the instructions I had received, I was unable to locate a method to obtain one.	negative
The iriver h10-20gb includes an equalizer, but it provides considerably more presets than the ipod.	negative
Specifically, it was unable to synchronize.	negative
To begin with, I want to mention that I received a 20GB iPod for Christmas, and I probably wouldn’t have spent the $300 on it myself.	negative
Due to a recent update, I cannot open more than a single browser window.	negative
if we could somehow squeeze a camera into it . .	negative
You have the option to "turn off" certain individual components, but don't be misled -- they remain present and operational.	negative
This problem happens solely at night; during the day, the display is fairly easy to view.	negative
Stay away from this item!	negative
You won't be able to accomplish that with a Sony T610 (which I exchanged for a 6600).	negative
Furthermore, if you manage to install it successfully, any problems with liveupdate or system works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating internet security.	negative
- no voice-activated dialing (what were they thinking)	negative
One major letdown is that the phones produced for T-Mobile are missing a lot of the menus and features that a Nokia directly from the manufacturer is expected to include.	negative
Ringtones typically consist of wild tunes and bothersome alerts; there's merely one ringtone that resembles a conventional phone ring.	negative
Their network service is quite inconsistent, and the system often appears to be overwhelmed, leading to a rather uncomfortable calling experience.	negative
the sole issue is the dimensions of the keys .	negative
I looked at numerous reviews for Norton Internet Security 2004 from different sources (CNET, Amazon, message boards) and concluded that NIS 04 was a horrible product and not worth upgrading.	negative
I reviewed the installation guidelines for both NIS 2004 and Navy 2004 before beginning the installation, but I still faced the same outcome... nonfunctional software.	negative
I don't utilize them, so I remove them to free up additional space.	negative
Furthermore, the absence of a voice recording function is notable, a feature that almost all MP3 players have, yet the iPod lacks.	negative
Additionally, when I call an "800" number, such as an airline, it doesn't permit me to use the number keys to navigate the pre-recorded menu.	negative
This is an awful company that offers a subpar product and provides dreadful support.	negative
What annoys me the most is that a program like this, which is not cheap, gets no support from Symantec; if you need help, they will bill you a fee!	negative
I had to give you a rating of four stars because the service for my brand-new iPod was very sluggish.	negative
the sole primary disadvantage is that the voice-dialing system is somewhat finicky.	negative
They claimed they would reimburse the entire amount, but a month later, they inform me that the back-up disc is non-refundable because its cost is solely for handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? -- and they have been defensive and confrontational over the phone and in emails.	negative
It's honestly so noisy that it doesn't work very well as a silent ringer option.	negative
I am pleased that I am not employed by Norton.	negative
The steel backing easily gathers fingerprints and scratches, which is not favorable from a cosmetic standpoint.	negative
We could begin by removing the glossy miracle-material casing that you can actually scratch just by glancing at it incorrectly, and thereby remove the requirement for third-party "requesting" protective cases for an additional thirty dollars.	negative
Avoid purchasing any home edition of Norton products.	negative
Another problem is that the headphone jack is specific to Nokia, meaning that regular headphones will not be compatible.	negative
Ever since I got the phone, I've dedicated numerous hours on the line with customer service representatives who assured me that t-zones would function "within 24 hours."	negative
Moreover, the standard ringtones provided with the device are awful.	negative
Sometimes, different applications fail to achieve success.	negative
2) The phone functions at a very sluggish pace.	negative
Moreover, upon reflection, it is quite disrespectful for Norton to presume that its customers ought to surmount these challenges -- anyone capable of providing a proof of purchase, whether via phone or online (what if your computer isn't working?), should receive the same level of priority.	negative
the menu appears after 3 seconds, and the image takes time to load from its sluggish card memory.	negative
Nevertheless, I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and with Symantec.	negative
the customer support is terrible.	negative
it's silent.	negative
- no exclusive headset jack	negative
Even though almost a dozen various representatives from both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply impractical to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the overwhelming majority of PDAs and a number of other devices.	negative
Initially, I believed this phone was somewhat oversized for me, perhaps a bit too complex.	negative
Another frustration with this is that you need to eliminate every trace of the prior version of Norton SystemWorks before installing this.	negative
I notice numerous other reviews that express the same sentiment . . . . avoid Norton, they aren't worthy of you, or anyone else! .	negative
When considering expandability (downloads via a computer), the different features, two transmission applications, and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that is not easily outgrown.	negative
their website provides no live assistance whatsoever.	negative
I'm tired of the silver appearance.	negative
If you possess an outdated version of "internet security" installed, you might also need to uninstall it prior to continuing with the installation of SystemWorks.	negative
The sole issue I encountered was that some components didn’t load properly at startup, but a reboot resolved the issue.	negative
It's crucial for individuals to be aware of the following: firstly, the interface is sluggish.	negative
The day ultimately came when I was certain I would depart from Sprint.	negative
You must also manually delete numerous Symantec files from the registry.	negative
However, the main problem that I think exists pertains to the audio quality.	negative
Wow, this truly does get damaged easily!	negative
There was a time it froze so severely that I couldn't even utilize the power button to switch it off, and I had to remove the battery.	negative
Aside from that, everything remains unchanged except for the new updates.	negative
Sometimes I cannot establish a connection to the phone using isync over Bluetooth, but I've noticed that restarting the phone tends to fix this issue.	negative
I am an advocate for Nokia, but this device and the later models (7610) seem to be a frantic effort to squeeze in too much undeveloped and experimental technology into a single badly designed phone.	negative
Caution! The Windows "Uninstall Program" function is not very effective at this, and neither is Norton’s own uninstallation tool.	negative
Who is willing to spend $30 to talk about a flaw in a product that just cost $95? (I also purchased the back-up CD.)	negative
My fingers are somewhat short, so it took some time to figure out how to press a key without accidentally hitting the neighboring ones.	negative
There are very few features on the iPod aside from games.	negative
We repeatedly faced alerts regarding "windows virtual memory low" errors, which were paired with absurd slowdowns and/or system crashes.	negative
It feels as though I'm experiencing the time of 56k dial-up internet again, even though I'm using a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB of RAM and have had dependable broadband service for the past year.	negative
The 6610 has a radio function that is completely pointless.	negative
I faced numerous similar issues that others have mentioned (mainly the sluggish processor), and afterward, I was unable to remove the annoying software from my computer entirely!	negative
The only complaint I have regarding the hardware is the buttons.	negative
this product encounters almost all the same installation issues.	negative
Concerning PC software support, Nokia Suite is incompatible with certain versions of XP, as I attempted to connect my phone using the infrared port on my laptop.	negative
It was only then that I realized the reality -- this phone does not work with palm PDAs!	negative
Furthermore, users cannot replace the batteries.	negative
The 6600 will offer comparable service in more developed regions of the states and will be less effective in more isolated areas.	negative
Essentially, the 6600 is a collection of exaggerated features that you don't require and won't need (if you do, consider acquiring a PDA or pocket PC), none of which function properly, and the fundamental phone capabilities and user experience are below average.	negative
This model does possess the classic key layout; it’s merely that the keys are quite near each other and have unusual shapes, making it a significant adjustment for someone like me who has large hands.	negative
Moreover, besides the delay each time you issue a command, it’s simply not very user-friendly when you’re out and about.	negative
Their technical assistance is not helpful either; they merely read from their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do so.	negative
The sole issue I've discovered with the internet service is that it struggles to access MLS (real estate broker software) effectively at all.	negative
This was clearly a scheme since it is incredibly simple to create a device with interchangeable batteries ! . ! .	negative
however, those two appear every single time.	negative
Nonetheless, I think that $299 is quite a significant sum for a device expected to last merely 18 months.	negative
They are not exceptional or pleasing.	negative
I'm truly sorry that I signed up with T-Mobile, but I'm trapped with them for the next 6 months of the agreement.	negative
Perhaps this new design is sturdier than the previous one, but I have some skepticism about it.	negative
boot up, sign out, sign in . . . everything turned quite sluggish.	negative
characteristics: honestly, there aren't any characteristics, unless you consider the games a characteristic.	negative
You press the message button on the front, and it takes just a few seconds to display the menu.	negative
The buttons on the phone are tiny, even for my petite fingertips, but you adapt to them fairly swiftly.	negative
the only thing i can come up with is no camera . . . .	negative
low visibility on the keys.	negative
I could hardly use it without requiring a recharge within two days!	negative
simply avoid being lured in by t-mobile's appealing rebate.	negative
One drawback I have is that I realize the iPod does not store the photos in a manner that maintains the quality of the image.	negative
To ensure clarity, here is my assessment of that product, modified to be suitable for this product, as they largely exhibit many of the same issues.	negative
no included accessories -- an arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be appreciated, but nope . . . movable components -- this makes me almost prefer my 3rd gen over a 4th; with movable components, it's easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is suited for more casual listeners; . note that the iPod mini lacks movable components and is constructed from titanium.	negative
the keys are positioned closely, and the arrangement is somewhat unconventional compared to standard rectangular layout keypads, but it's not overly strange.	negative
I dedicated several hours arranging the stations (which accommodates around 13-14, I think), although the reception tends to be inconsistent.	negative
Nonetheless, the battery's longevity isn't as satisfactory as I would prefer.	negative
Initially, it is crucial, critical installation issues.	negative
Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying out lock picking.	negative
however, it wouldn't allow me to re-enable the av protection and it wouldn't cease with the notifications.	negative
Several users on a single machine never appeared to function as you would anticipate.	negative
This procedure can be quite frustrating and hazardous when you are operating a manual transmission on the freeway.	negative
The pictures in the contact list are horribly resized as well; they appear as if they were constructed from Legos.	negative
At the moment, there are no issues, just an ongoing feeling of letdown regarding how Norton has neglected their customers.	negative
I find the scarcity of engaging games on this phone rather unsettling.	negative
If there is no earlier version of Norton Security or Norton Antivirus on your computer, the installation should go smoothly; however, if there are leftovers, get ready for a major registry cleanup! The former software can leave behind remnants that might disrupt the new installation, even if you have entirely removed the old programs.	negative
In my opinion, when you consider the cost relative to the iPod, the Creative Zen offers decent value.	positive
We store the diaper champ in our daughter's nursery, and her room certainly does not have the odor of soiled diapers.	positive
The infrared feature is a great advantage if you own an older Nokia and need to transfer your contact list to this device, it saved me countless hours of manually inputting my numbers again.	positive
We have not encountered any issues with loose wipes becoming stuck (we always bundle them in the used diaper).	positive
The installation in XP was quick and easy to understand.	positive
The earbud headphones are quite pleasant.	positive
I believe it is wonderful.	positive
We disinfect the champ with Lysol every time we replace the bag, and we haven't encountered any issues.	positive
On the other hand, I'm rather happy with my upgrade.	positive
Furthermore, it is quite simple to configure.	positive
I anticipated that the 12x digital zoom would appear grainy, but at full size with high to fine quality, the zoomed images are rather remarkable.	positive
the battery has a long lifespan.	positive
I have been amazed by the strength of the Hitachi M12V.	positive
I've possessed a creative audio device since 1993 and have never needed to contact technical support.	positive
I previously owned a Sony Ericsson T610, and the T610 is significantly less impressive.	positive
The 4300 includes great software that is simple to set up; I utilize it on XP and Win98 without issues, along with a battery charger, USB, and video cable.	positive
the menus are simple to navigate through ; . they are organized intuitively , and are logical .	positive
After an extensive and thorough search for a compact camera that is rich in features and delivers excellent performance, I was first attracted to this small gem because of its remarkable picture quality of 4 megapixels.	positive
advancing to the audio team . . . it provides ! .	positive
this camera is ideal for a passionate amateur photographer.	positive
It makes the nomad I bought appear and feel like garbage.	positive
I had the iPod Mini, and it functions on par with my sound card, but the micro exceeds it entirely.	positive
the movie mode is also operating effectively.	positive
The gadget appears quite sleek, I believe (just like the images suggest), it fits comfortably and is light in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are straightforward enough to operate after a little practice.	positive
the micro appeared to be an ipod for a lower price.	positive
I believed the FM radio wouldn't be very useful with all the tracks at my disposal, but it's fantastic for catching TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and shows that are being simulcast, NPR, and much more.	positive
I adore the speakerphone.	positive
Utilizing 65536 (16bit) colors guarantees that you receive your portion of animations and icons on your mobile device.	positive
I take pleasure in becoming accustomed to the touch pad.	positive
Furthermore, it includes a stylish and potent headset.	positive
assign a unique ringtone to each friend.	positive
I take pictures in jog format, and since the phone is equipped with a Bluetooth device, I find it very convenient to transfer images to my PC and back.	positive
I have truly liked the camera on this smartphone.	positive
It's quite simple to swap out bits without taking the router off the table, and the shaft lock functions effectively.	positive
If I were to do it again, I wouldn't choose anything else.	positive
This is the greatest mobile device I have encountered.	positive
The software that comes with this camera is superb.	positive
Secondly, all information can be transmitted to a computer without the inconvenience of USB cables.	positive
In terms of technology, I believe this is amazing, and the speaker enhances it even more! ! ! ! ! I adore this smartphone! ! ! ! !	positive
As I previously stated, I have no remorse regarding the purchase at all.	positive
Thus, dependability is the champion in this case for the iPod.	positive
excellent quality images and videos are awesome ! .	positive
Its dimensions also render it perfect for traveling.	positive
Considering the price of one of those high-end models, I've got a solid router and a nice table to place it on, which I appreciate.	positive
I should mention that establishing the email account was quite easy and straightforward, although it necessitates an external smut server to operate.	positive
I have used different pails, but none have matched up favorably to the champ.	positive
I really appreciate how tiny it is, and the blue light - I've owned it for two weeks without any electronic issues whatsoever.	positive
If you're looking for a wireless router for your home or a tiny business, you can simply acquire a wrt54g from here and set it up.	positive
The individual on the opposite side of the call can hear you clearly.	positive
If you're looking to work without wires, this router accomplishes everything you need, and my tech-savvy friends claim that the security is top-notch at the moment.	positive
This updated click wheel iPod lets you move through the menus and songs using a touch wheel for scrolling and clickable buttons for selection.	positive
It certainly prevents the odor from coming in.	positive
I adore my deep blue Zen Micro and would certainly suggest it.	positive
During my time with the phone, its positive attributes included: superb sound quality and an exceptional FM radio paired with earbuds.	positive
If you utilize Linux and desire GPS and/or wish to employ a hands-free Bluetooth device, and seek a good camera -- this is the device for you.	positive
the quality is substantial and you'll feel quite pleased from conserving time and the frustration.	positive
The setup functions great; similar to any tool, I examine each individual tool for its advantages, rather than evaluating the company as a whole.	positive
I'm intending to acquire a second one for my router table!	positive
Honestly! I adore it!	positive
a smart expenditure for the wallet & for the scent ! . ! . ! .	positive
The plunge lock and power switch are easily reachable, which is crucial when executing freehand routing.	positive
The images can be enhanced using Photoshop, and printed at 4x6, and they appear fantastic!	positive
As I set out to purchase a cellphone, I was completely resolved to choose a Nokia exclusively, as it is the finest among cellphones.	positive
The design is quite appealing, and the colors are also nice.	positive
The Nikon Coolpix series is a well-established range, so you can expect that support and parts will be accessible even when Nikon launches a more recent model.	positive
I highly endorse T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600.	positive
what amazed me the most was the noise .	positive
restart the network, checked the connection, and it works perfectly.	positive
nice little gadget . . . easy to carry . .	positive
It is very well built and has withstood sliding across floors and pavements without any harm.	positive
I believe the Nikon 4300 is the top camera available considering its features and cost.	positive
This is an excellent router for a table, and the dial for depth adjustment enables effortless and accurate depth modifications.	positive
it's extremely tiny.	positive
If presented with the chance, I would improve my inventive muvo2 and capture a zen micro by the next day.	positive
I also have a retail shop, and this small device conveniently connects to the aux input of my store's audio system.	positive
I simply swapped out my old linksys router for this new one, powered everything on in the correct sequence, and it started working without any issues.	positive
Aside from the inability to delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is outstanding and particularly easy to navigate.	positive
Five gigabytes is enough for my amazing albums.	positive
The guide is straightforward, and it is largely foolproof.	positive
Bluetooth doesn't deplete the battery as rapidly as I expected; I can typically last 1.5 days with Bluetooth activated while making calls before requiring a complete recharge.	positive
two : it features a removable/rechargeable battery, which signifies that you do not need to send the device in when the re ! .	positive
Keep in mind that this device runs on an operating system - Symbian . . . and it has a variety of features with 65k colors.	positive
It has enough heft to provide stability, but it is not too heavy to hinder manual operation.	positive
I bought my Zen Micro three months ago mainly because I preferred its size and design over that of the iPod Mini.	positive
When outside the T-Mobile coverage zone, the phone effortlessly switched to AT&T Wireless and several other networks where T-Mobile service was not available.	positive
This is the fourth Linksys device I've bought, and although the beginning was somewhat challenging, I'm really happy with this router.	positive
I was shocked by what I had overlooked.	positive
The only complimentary assistance you receive is when renewing your subscription!	positive
It's really neat that you can set ringtones for individuals and/or groups.	positive
The quality of images in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from that of 35mm.	positive
the quality is excellent.	positive
There is no comparison; the Champ is direct and odorless, while the Genie was hard to operate with one hand (which is absolutely essential if you have a little one on a changing pad), and there was indeed a noticeable smell coming from the Genie. Additionally, we discovered that the quick-tie garbage bags, where the ties are integrated into the bag, work very effectively because there isn't any extra bulk around the sealing edge of the Champ.	positive
I also appreciate that you can modify your mp3 titles, and so on.	positive
I have had this router for more than 8 years and I am kind of pleased with it.	positive
the standard and artistry of the item are exceptional.	positive
As I utilize it in a table, I do not employ the plunge feature, but should I ever require it, I have it available.	positive
I really appreciate the diaper champ; it is extremely simple to operate, and because you can utilize standard garbage bags, it doesn't break the bank for refills.	positive
2. It can be used with one hand, allowing you to keep a hand on your baby on the changing table.	positive
The battery life is remarkable, exceeding the 8-10 hours that appears reasonable for most music players available today.	positive
the primary benefit of this system compared to its predecessor is the capability to create a broader pipeline between clients.	positive
Making phone calls to your home from different nations can be very expensive, but sending instant messages to and from the participating countries in Europe is affordably priced.	positive
the smartphones are amazing .	positive
1. Capture approximately 1 hour of video using a Phillips camcorder pro.	positive
I appreciate the dimensions and form.	positive
I desired this product since it didn't require purchasing special bags for it, and it was also highly recommended.	positive
