superb mobile device, I 'd buy another.	positive
the battery lifespan is less than extraordinary , but it recharges w/ the quickness .	positive

unfavorable : impossibly minuscule and hard to manipulate , hardly noticeable , power switch .	negative
and the vitality presence is absent ! .	negative
1-a cell phone is to place calls, in other terms, quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most vital, the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker, you'd have to press it firmly against your ear to hear anything the other person is stating, unless the environment was completely silent.	negative
for the past month my rebate condition indicating to me that my rebate is accepted and check is sent but still I am awaiting for check.	negative
particularly the bluetooth host . . . signifying you have to reboot the phone if you desire bluetooth to function again .	negative
there isn't numerous traits on the ipod at all, except for games.	negative
after years with that provider's costly packages and terrible client support, portability appeared like a godsend.	negative
nearly from the outset, liveupdate would not operate.	negative
I possess superb hearing but the sound level on this device is particularly muted.	negative
I'm at peak capacity! . ! . ! . ! . I reached out to Symantec and they said they don't know why but I should get technician's support at $35/hr to assist! . ! . I did reach out to them and was on hold for 55 minutes until I hung up! .	negative
the navigation consumes so much time that it would ultimately drive you mad.	negative
first of all, i 've never been enthusiastic about earbuds - they 're just not that comfy.	negative
this item has practically all the same setup issues.	negative
one warning i have is that i comprehend the ipod does not store the pictures in such a manner that the quality of the image is maintained .	negative
the ipod arrives set up for the mac, but within moments of connecting it to a pc, is instantly reformatted for windows. ( the hp edition comes with windows formatting, and takes moments to switch to mac. ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another, you will forfeit all of your music and data when doing so.	negative
Symantec ought to provide us all a reimbursement and apology!	negative
essentially, I consumed the expense of the renewal and absorbed the expense of the tech assistance.	negative
my final easier nokia powered up promptly and was instantly prepared for utilization.	negative
if you encounter issues with setup, you can visit symantec's site, click the assistance tab, click the 'home or home office assistance' and there is an automated support helper that can examine the norton program files on your computer and it will inform you what is not functioning correctly and how to resolve it.	negative
Evidently, T-Mobile is significantly inundated and cannot maintain pace with demands.	negative
tone melodies only arrive with bizarre tracks and irritating chimes, there is merely one bell that resonates near to a typical ring.	negative
my ipod ceases intermittently, which is particularly irritating when you're in the midst of a game of "brick."	negative
it 's not as designed as a sony or samsung .	negative
it was immediately evident that nis obstructs my computer ( pent4 , 256 ram ) .	negative
appearance and sturdiness: I recognize many individuals are fond of the simplistic white interface.	negative
its silent .	negative
battery : in contrast to the other rivals on the market , the ipod has one of the weakest batteries obtainable .	negative
the sole primary disadvantage is the reality that the voice-dialing system is somewhat finicky.	negative
initiate, sign off, sign in . . . everything turned quite sluggish.	negative
I attempted disabling the various elements offered with this product, reducing it all the way back to anti-virus only service . . . and observed no enhancement.	negative
I possess a contemporary computer with plenty of speed and storage, but this firewall just brought it to a standstill.	negative
thus, do not purchase this or enhance.	negative
regrettably , it does not provide you the choice of installing ( or installing ) them separately .	negative
Ultimately, I reiterate my discontent assessment for T-Mobile as a vendor.	negative
T-Mobile wasn't explicit about some of the criteria to qualify for the rebate.	negative
I discover the absence of engaging games on this smartphone rather unsettling.	negative
now in october, 2004, the obstruction stated i couldn 't permit anymore requests to use the internet because its congested.	negative
steer clear of this item at all expenses.	negative
client assistance : terrible . hear this one , recall the battery remark i made earlier .	negative
Subsequent to a recent enhancement, I can no longer launch more than one internet browser window.	negative
The only concern that I have found with the internet service is that it does not extend to mils (real estate broker software) very inadequately at all.	negative
cons : no am/fm radio receiver -- something a significant number of rivals are doing	negative
the sole drawback i have discovered with this phone is that it is a tad sluggish to respond , meaning when i press the contacts button , it takes some time to load , this is accurate for nearly all the menus and applications on the phone .	negative
nonetheless, the strength duration isn't as significant as I would desire.	negative
I will never purchase their item again at this pace, and neither ought you.	negative
Norton online assistance does not even recognize this issue nor does the computer firm that pre-installed it on our new machine.	negative
I am an IT specialist and have employed Norton for years, but this product is a complete and absolute disaster.	negative
you can 't alter the battery , so i don 't understand what i 'm going to do in a year or so .	negative
For reasons of lucidity, here is my evaluation from that item, modified to be suitable for this product, since, for the majority, they possess many of the same issues.	negative
the battery energy depletes quickly particularly on utilizing the internet browser.	negative
after exploring the different forums i find this is a sporadic and pervasive problem .	negative
I examined numerous critiques on Norton Internet Security 2004 from a range of sources (CNET, Amazon, discussion boards) and reached the conclusion that NIS 04 was a dreadful product and not worth the upgrade.	negative
its metallic backing gathers fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a visual standpoint.	negative
when I buy software, I never want to have to spend hours searching for remedies to my installation issues -- in particular remedies that involve manually adjusting driver settings or modifying the registry ! .	negative
i 've had to install and remove them four or five times so far , and i 've not been able to get either product functioning properly .	negative
also, their t-zones, although inexpensive ($4.99/mo.), never functions.	negative
I attempted it again this morning and it indicated I didn’t possess the necessary "permissions" and lacked adequate administrator status.	negative
I truly lament enrolling with T-Mobile, but I’m trapped with them for the next 6 months of the agreement.	negative
nevertheless, I am extremely disheartened with this item and with Symantec.	negative
it seems like i 'm returned to the era of 56k dial-up internet service , even though i 'm utilizing a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have faced excellent broadband service for the previous year .	negative
To install that edition you have to remove from the window registry anything labeled symantec or norton, . . . also from the shared files in the program directory the symantec directory has to be eliminated.	negative
Occasionally, numerous programs fail.	negative
another aspect you should be aware of, the metal on the reverse side of the ipod is quite sticky, and scratches very readily.	negative
Norton assistance is entirely miserable.	negative
it's a scam if one purchases norton internet protection and malware defense.	negative
but those 2 arise every time.	negative
I already recognized something was amiss, because much of the junk I’ve encountered in the previous six months was from merchants of Norton products.	negative
I experienced many of the same issues that everyone else has mentioned ( mainly the sluggish processor ) , and then I couldn't remove the damn thing from my computer entirely ! .	negative
if you contact apple and inform them your ipod has been harmed, they bill you approximately $105. 50 per minute and accuse you of " mistreating " your ipod .	negative
apple's ipod power cell replacement service charges $100!	negative
but if I installed either one of these Norton applications, neither operates after installation?	negative
I utterly detest Symantec. I swear, if I could have truly yanked that software out of my computer with my naked, bleeding hands, I would have.	negative
the other irritation with this that you have to eliminate every single trace of prior version of norton systemworks before you installs this .	negative
one additional thing, the standard ringtones that arrive with the phone are dreadful.	negative
initially, it critical, critical setup issues.	negative
and i can 't alert you enough to keep away from norton ! . ! .	negative
sacred calf ! . it truly does scratch easily ! .	negative
but, I am rather displeased with Nokia at the present moment.	negative
- no voice-activated dialing (what were they contemplating)	negative
If you are already utilizing a previous edition of Norton security and uninstalled it to install the enhanced version, you will still encounter all sorts of issues in installing the novel version on your system!	negative
an abundance of " pieces " remained in the registry, and it the norton system directories.	negative
the menu choices emerge one at a time, occupying the entire screen, and one must scroll down individually, or have memorized where they are in the menu sequence, to choose them by utilizing the number keypad.	negative
Is it vital to examine my ms currency database when I shut the program?	negative
ultimately you will uncover just how inadequate nokia is, and why their recent decrease of market share is so completely justified.	negative
it has an equalizer, but the iriver h10-20gb has numerous more presets than the ipod.	negative
one drawback : as of this moment , t-mobile has n 't refreshed their t-zone system to completely accommodate the 6610 .	negative
but this doesn 't compensate for it 's countless other deficiencies, the largest of which is the incapacity to download any updates due to issues with liveupdate .	negative
In my view, the most significant problem with this phone is the side-mounted volume adjustment.	negative
2) mobile phone is painfully slow.	negative
I accomplished it and it was worse the second time around . . . inconceivable .	negative
It 's essential that individuals are aware of the subsequent: initially, the interface is sluggish.	negative
the sole issue is the dimension of the keys .	negative
I have never encountered this issue with any other application on my computer.	negative
the keys are near together , and the arrangement is a bit odd in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too strange .	negative
I ultimately obtained a complimentary support number for Norton through my USP assistance staff, but waited an hour or longer for a voice.	negative
I cannot locate a cover for this phone I prefer, end up just throwing it in my bag.	negative
there is no method you can communicate with client support about this.	negative
my sole grievance ( truly more of a remark ) is that the external coating of the ipod is quite fragile , so i am going to obtain a cover for mine so it doesn't get all scuffed up .	negative
although nearly a dozen distinct individuals at both t-mobile and nokia have informed me otherwise, it is merely not feasible to utilize this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and numerous other gadgets.	negative
simply the home edition of norton internet/av has countless glitches and issues to even slightly concern about.	negative
it also has a inventory monitoring app integrated ( also pointless ) and a somewhat beneficial application which transforms all kinds of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .	negative
buttons do appear a little adhesive tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector could be an issue . .	negative
the largest issue is the setup .	negative
what disappoints me the most is that a program like that is not inexpensive receives zero assistance from symantec, if you seek help, they’ll charge you a fee!	negative
this product is entirely unready for release.	negative
the subsequent issue was that it didn 't identify all the installed elements , so it would not refresh them , most notably and significantly , malware definitions .	negative
the loudness key can be difficult to press , but i believe this may be by intention rather than a defect , perhaps to prevent you from pressing it unintentionally when you are on a call .	negative
specific, it wouldn't correspond.	negative
no issues now, just a feeble disillusionment in the manner norton has deserted their clients.	negative
I have discovered too many issues in Norton Internet Security Professional to endorse it to anyone without considerable patience and proficiency.	negative
appears the " program scan " function did not locate the exe file for outlook ! .	negative
also if you do succeed in getting it set up, any issues with liveupdate or with system operations will also impact the functionality and/or the procedure of refreshing internet security.	negative
- some characteristics in the user interface	negative
Furthermore, the batteries aren't user exchangeable.	negative
it was a symantec mistake.	negative
we often encountered "windows virtual memory low" error notifications appearing followed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or failures.	negative
during installation, nis would either stall or not restart correctly when prompted to do so.	negative
*   negative
acquiring software that cannot be installed typically and being placed into the dilemma of having a non-functional computer.	negative
4- my notion was that it was an all-in-one, and that theory -once again- proves incorrect, this phone excels at nothing, less than average in everything, if you genuinely require any of the "other than phone" functionalities, you'll be disappointed . . . . if you have plenty of cash and acquired it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don't expect to get much done.	negative
when you contemplate expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the myriad features , two transmission applications and multiple storage units , reliability - this is a phone that isn 't simple to surpass .	negative
our norton internet/av 2004 was awful right from the start, so i 'd assume that if steelworks is fine now, it should stay fine .	negative
i 'm an proponent of nokia, but this handset and the subsequent models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a frantic attempt at squeezing as much underdeveloped and experimental technologies in one careless phone .	negative
there will be much deleting of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual characters.	negative
I assign it 4-stars solely because the setup procedure - or rather issues that may arise during the setup procedure - can be exasperating to the typical computer user.	negative
exclusively if we could acquire one lens in it . .	negative
3 no audio recorder -- this has also become a notable and favored feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn't have.	negative
a little let down on that ! .	negative
if you possess no prior edition of norton security on your system, or norton antivirus, the installation will proceed smoothly, otherwise delve in and conduct a significant registry cleanup! the obsolete programs will leave a mark that will disrupt the new installation, even if you removed the old programs flawlessly.	negative
4 ) buttons are rather diminutive and is genuinely a hassle exp if one is keen on text messaging.	negative
the ipod is excessively responsive to just about everything and gets scuffed easily .	negative
- no exclusive headset socket	negative
and , when you contemplate it , it 's offensive that norton demands its clients to leap through these hoops -- anyone who can present evidence of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is malfunctioning ? . ) , should have equal precedence .	negative
only one grievance about the speakerphone, you can only enable the speakerphone function once the individual you are contacting responds to the phone, not while it is ringing.	negative
t610 accommodates solely midi files.	negative
while I was attempting to play half life 2 it began appearing with " notifications " every twenty seconds ( literally ) , cautioning me my antivirus security was disabled .	negative
their technical support isn’t helpful either ; . they merely read what’s on their site and charge you $50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .	negative
when I ultimately got it functioning, it only operated correctly for numerous months.	negative
the largest warning sign for me was the fact that although my cousin's athlete was comparatively new, it was filled with nicks.	negative
I observe numerous other evaluations that express the same . . . . steer clear of Norton, they don't merit you, or anyone! .	negative
i 'm scoring it 1 star because as compared to other nokia gadgets, its a 1, compared to other blunders by other brands (such as samsung and motorola) it might be satisfactory . . . . but if you 're acquiring a nokia, don 't choose this one .	negative
in brief - nokia themselves don 't realize that this phone doesn 't function with the palm , and if you don 't follow my recommendation you will waste hours with technicians around the planet reading from scripts , admonishing you in broken english for not adhering to their instructions exactly .	negative
then, my advertisement/pop-up obstructing was entirely absent.	negative
they genuinely are awfully minuscule.	negative
Concerning PC software assistance, Nokia Suite does not function with certain editions of XP as I attempted to link my phone via infrared port on my laptop.	negative
low clarity on the buttons.	negative
doesn't possess a lot of top-notch games on it.	negative
naturally, if you attempt to contact symantec support you encounter ineffective automated systems unless you wish to pay $30 per issue.	negative
I have reviewed the setup guidelines for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same outcome . . . worthless software .	negative
the 6610 includes the audio capability which is entirely useless.	negative
I 've always appreciated Symantec offerings, except for this edition 2004.	negative
don't employ them, so I eliminate them for extra space.	negative
the vibration is not summit.	negative
As a Windows user, I had to set up the software including drivers and iTunes on my computer, and this is the sole area where I faced an annoyance.	negative
nevertheless, in my opinion, $299 is a considerable amount to spend for a gadget that will merely endure 18 months.	negative
their website provides no real assistance at all.	negative
my sole complaint regarding the hardware is the controls .	negative
one additional concern is that the headphone port is distinctive to nokia, so regular headphones will not function.	negative
the back of the ipod is in a chrome sheen, and this surface is prone to scratches.	negative
this edition of internet protection 2004, is beyond redemption.	negative
when speaking the tone is not very distinct.	negative
the sole issue i encountered was a couple of elements didn 't quite load properly upon startup , but a restart resolved the issue .	negative
games sort of smell and you cannot download them you have to acquire the link cable to obtain additional games.	negative
the magnitude .	negative
there is absolutely nothing advantageous at the symantec/norton site.	negative
I presumed they had outstanding service, but their reception in my region (Los Angeles) is dreadful.	negative
Norton has been on a declining trajectory recently with their offerings, but with this one, they have fallen off the brink.	negative
the accumulator issue is superficially a worry, but any sensible solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can insert a new one when the moment comes ( based upon the abundant info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod accumulator replacement ' ) .	negative
I was utilizing a Motorola t720i with Verizon and I experienced numerous dropped calls and I encountered difficulties syncing data.	negative
Norton Internet Protection 2004 is one of the more problematic implementations.	negative
the sole issue i encountered was a minor hiccup with t-mobile .	negative
so I e-mailed the virtual technical assistance with that simple inquiry, and received a response which was completely unhelpful ( it appeared as though they didn't actually review the e-mail and just sent back a few template excerpts ).	negative
this mobile is not appropriate for quick individuals, perhaps only for elderly people.	negative
5) video recorder is of no value and one cannot document something beneficial in 10 seconds and it requires some time to transmit the same through the "complimentary image and video messaging" provided by service supplier.	negative
following 4 attempted setups, I have ultimately given up.	negative
but I had to give you four because the assistance for my brand-new ipod was dreadfully sluggish .	negative
I am uninterested with the silver appearance.	negative
I am an experienced computer user, so I cannot even fathom how a new or inexperienced user would ever get this awful program to function!	negative
even though I have the guardian restrictions off it constantly begins updating them then halts my computer.	negative
caution ! . the windows " uninstall application " function does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton's own elimination tool .	negative
the device has a few minor annoyances, but only because it lacks those functionalities, bluetooth and high-cost internet, but there are very few issues with things that you anticipated this phone to accomplish.	negative
once more it won't reinstall, even with online and email support from symantec specialists.	negative
purchase this if you enjoy intellectual challenges or testing how to open locks.	negative
it would not detach on conversations.	negative
the display is readily scratched but if you possess the warranty you ought to be capable of exchanging it out.	negative
I am awarding a zero star to Symantec for this edition!	negative
then when i visited norton 's site to acquire a priority id number according to the directions i had been provided , i couldn 't locate a method to obtain one .	negative
there are some characteristics in the user interface that I find a bit bothersome.	negative
this occasion, it initiated the setup procedure, then I departed for work. I believe it will function. I wish it will operate.	negative
the finest thing to do with this edition, is to leave it on the store shelf. it doesn 't function, and will cost you a tremendous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned cash.	negative
I consider this attribute on this device pointless, but, since I don't genuinely require this function anyway, I don't truly utilize it.	negative
the more delicate hues that were incorporated with the phone are difficult to perceive at times .	negative
certain they claim if it 's their blame you won 't be billed , but they are the ones who get to determine whether it 's their blame .	negative
computer cord is too pricey . . . $ 50 for a usb cord ? .	negative
this software would not permit me to dispatch outlook email or listen to audible sample audiobooks online.	negative
the menu appears after 3 seconds the image takes a while to load from its sluggish card memory .	negative
it halted during setup and i had to reformat the drive and start from zero ( greer ! . )	negative
after notifying the representative and his technical overseer the problem the only reply was to eliminate the program ( which i had already done ) . . .	negative
this mobile doesn 't incorporate phone card dialing .	negative
starting up my computer took ages ! . ! . ! .	negative
up to now i haven 't had so many grievances except that i still haven 't perfected how to scandisk when utilizing internet security .	negative
I could barely utilize it without a recharge in 2 days!	negative
we can commence by discarding the glossy miracle-substance casing that you can truly scratch just by gazing at it improperly, and thus eradicate the necessity for third-party " inquiring " protective casings for an additional thirty dollars.	negative
there is no picture viewing choice, however, there is a 20 gb photograph ipod, but it costs $20 additional.	negative
I must have listened to this about a dozen times over the duration of 2 weeks, when t-zones never functioned.	negative
I had an inquiry about the advantages and disadvantages of disabling the Norton firewall versus the Windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to converse with a tech support agent because I did not possess a "customer priority identification number."	negative
I 'm likely the sole individual that detests the itunes program.	negative
Essentially, the 6600 is a compilation of exaggerated features you don't and won't require (if you do, acquire a PDA or pocket PC), none of them function as they ought, and the basic phone capabilities and ergonomics are inferior.	negative
the web capabilities of the phone - wap and gprs - will only operate through t-mobile 's offerings, because they have removed the menu choices that would allow you to set up the phone to be used on an alternative network .	negative
I had attempted to remove Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't allow me to do that either.	negative
2- it is cumbersome and the tiny buttons on the sides are unwieldy to use.	negative
among its weak facets is the mmc slot position and a somewhat ambiguous design.	negative
occasionally when you push buttons , the menu shows up after a moment or two .	negative
it additionally lacks voice activated dialing. significant drawback! . ! .	negative
I mean, they’re concise! .	negative
once more, every critique composed about the tech line is accurate . . . after waiting nearly 45 minutes i ultimately conversed with a representative .	negative
just don't get lured into t-mobile's appealing refund.	negative
nevertheless, the calls frequently disconnect in my region and I encounter extreme static, to the extent where I’d need to dial numbers 6-7 times to obtain a clear connection.	negative
ultimately , after roughly a week 's usage , the display began to freeze on me .	negative
if you presently possess the 2003 edition, and are seeking to enhance to the 2004 edition, don 't.	negative
I will state that the operating system that the phone operates does possess a few problems.	negative
the pictures in the contact directory are terribly resized too ; . they seem as though they were built out of legos .	negative
nevertheless, symantec has made a considerable shift for the worse with this launch.	negative
they stated they would reimburse all the funds, but a month later, they inform me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its price is solely handling and shipping - $15 to " manage " and send a cd? . -- and they have been irate and confrontational on the phone and in emails .	negative
the menu choices are uninspired , as you can 't view a complete screen of menu items to choose from ; . you have to scroll up and down to locate what you 're searching for ( yes , this is trivial , but not when you 're attempting to keep your eye on the road ! . ) .	negative
there are some peaks to the 2004 version, but mainly lows.	negative
now the negative : 1 ) as customary , battery energy not adequate for daily usage .	negative
secondly, in addition to the holdup each time you give a command, it 's just not that readily manageable on the go.	negative
numerous users on a single machine never appeared to act like you 'd anticipate .	negative
Since I acquired the phone, I invested countless hours on the phone with customer support representatives who assured t-zones would function "in 24 hours."	negative
their network coverage is very erratic, and the network always appears congested, resulting in very unpleasant calling experience.	negative
the power duration can 't be very lengthy ; . let 's not be avaricious .	negative
Initially, it faltered whenever linking to obtain updates.	negative
my old sony ericsson t610 possesses this characteristic.	negative
even though I disabled Norton antispam, it is still existent.	negative
after 10 years, i now acquired mccaffee's product after contacting their assistance . . . . they responded swiftly, and at no cost, and were extremely useful .	negative
other objects that I yearn for are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm audio jack.	negative
after numerous years of torment in the grasp of at&t customer assistance i am thrilled to abandon them , and anticipate august 2004 when i will transform our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! .	negative
the illumination on the phone turns off far too swiftly ( hazardous when you 're operating a vehicle at night ) , and there 's no method to modify this --	negative
this is merely a dilemma at night, during the daylight the display is very simple to view.	negative
I acquired this compilation from Norton, and within moments my internet connection wavered and my PC was nearly immobilized due to registry problems from the download.	negative
yeah - this software safeguards your computer all right - by barring you from the web.	negative
the " films " last approximately 5 moments .	negative

i 'm assigning it 1 star because as compared to other nokia mobiles, its a 1, compared to other mistakes by other companies (such as samsung and motorola) it might be fine . . . . but if you 're purchasing a nokia, don 't acquire this one .	negative

setting it up for a domestic network was nearly unfeasible.	negative
my sole grievance ( truly more of a remark ) is that the exterior coating of the ipod is fairly fragile , so i am going to acquire a cover for mine so it doesn't get all scuffed up .	negative
I must have listened to this about a dozen times over the duration of 2 weeks, when t-zones never functioned.	negative
client support : terrible . hear this one , recall the battery remark i stated earlier .	negative
appears the " program search " function did not locate the exe file for outlook ! .	negative
the menu choices are uninspired , as you can 't view a complete screen of menu items to select from ; . you have to scroll up and down to locate what you 're searching for ( yes , this is trivial , but not when you 're attempting to keep your eye on the road ! . ) .	negative
so i e-mailed the virtual tech assistance with that straightforward inquiry, and received a response which was completely unhelpful ( it appeared as though they didn't actually examine the e-mail and merely sent back a few template paragraphs ).	negative

however, it requires to be fairly silent for it to function at all -- doesn't function at all in the vehicle, for instance.	negative
this software would not permit me to dispatch outlook email or listen to audible preview books online .	negative
the back of the ipod is in a metallic finish, and this exterior is vulnerable to scratches.	negative
and the vitality presence is absent ! .	negative
the quantity buttons are packed into a 3x4cm space , the typefaces are tiny , the interface is too complicated and irritating , it 's not that adaptable as well .	negative
it is defective, slow and essentially annoys the heck out of the user.	negative
Personally, I might never buy Symantec items again.	negative
the interface required a bit of acclimating to .	negative
they possess the poorest service of any of the leading companies.	negative
despite I deactivated norton antispam, it is still present.	negative
Is it crucial to inspect my ms money database when I close the application?	negative
similar to the majority of their resolutions ( which initially accuse other programs for mistakes ) , the technical individuals stance was that this was likely a microsoft mistake - it was not .	negative
while i was attempting to play half life 2 it commenced appearing with " notifications " every twenty seconds ( literally ) , cautioning me my antivirus security was disabled .	negative
4- my belief was that it was an all-in-one, and that presumption -once again- proves incorrect, this phone excels at nothing, less than average in everything, if you truly need any of the " other than phone " functionalities, you'll be disillusioned . . . . if you have plenty of cash and purchased it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect accomplishing much.	negative
occasionally when you push buttons, the menu shows up after a moment or two.	negative
I have never encountered this issue with any other program on my computer.	negative
they are a royal nuisance to set up, and don't operate correctly once finally set up -- if you can set them up at all.	negative
As a devoted client of Norton/Symantec products, I acquired Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more unhappy with the product (and hence the one star rating).	negative
the ms scandisk would show up due to manual shutdown and would only examine to the 2nd bar, repeatedly ( up to 1 hr, i then powered it down and utilized go back ).	negative
t610 accommodates solely midi files.	negative
3 no audio recorder -- this has also turned into a significant and favored attribute that the ipod regrettably doesn't possess.	negative
hard disk malfunctions sporadically	negative
doesn 't possess a lot of great games on it .	negative
extended reboots due to Norton taking forever to boot up.	negative
steer clear of this item at all expenses.	negative
so far i haven 't had so many grievances except that i still haven 't perfected how to scandisk when utilizing internet security .	negative
apple shut their isle to anything that looked like microsoft, and clearly informed napster that it could not utilize their products with napster's services.	negative
I possess exceptional hearing but the loudness on this device is particularly subdued.	negative
the os is a bit perplexing at 1st , but within a few days you will overcome this learning curve ! .	negative
but if I installed either one of these Norton programs, neither functions after setup?	negative
thus, straight out of the package I encountered difficulty.	negative
this device doesn 't contain phone card calling .	negative
nevertheless, I suspect that numerous individuals are encountering a negative experience -- refrain from buying this item.	negative
I ultimately obtained a complimentary support number for Norton through my USP assistance staff, but waited an hour or longer for a voice.	negative
apple's ipod power cell replacement service expenses $100 ! .	negative
the power issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-worker (such as myself : - ) can insert a new one when the moment arrives (based upon the plentiful info obtained from a go ogle for 'ipod power replacement').	negative
if you contact apple and inform them your ipod has been harmed, they charge you approximately $105. 50 per minute and accuse you of " mistreating " your ipod .	negative
the issues I encountered installing Norton extended far beyond what Symantec should reasonably anticipate the public to handle.	negative
Regrettably, I traded it precisely a month afterward.	negative
Naturally, if you attempt to contact Symantec support, you encounter ineffective automated systems unless you’re willing to spend $30 per incident.	negative
the web capabilities of the phone - wap and gprs - will solely operate through t-mobile 's services, because they have removed the menu choices that would allow you to set up the phone to be utilized on an alternative network .	negative
when I came back it home, I uncovered that the choices for transmitting messages via either text or email simply weren't accessible:	negative
starting up my computer required ages ! . ! . ! .	negative
after numerous years of torment in the grip of at&t customer support i am thrilled to abandon them , and anticipate august 2004 when i will switch our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! .	negative
I observed a few grievances regarding the loading duration of menus, and I believe individuals are over-exaggerating the menu loading duration.	negative
it's a scam if one purchases norton internet protection and malware defense.	negative
now in october , 2004 , the barrier said i couldn 't permit anymore applications to use the internet because its packed .	negative
Ultimately, I reiterate my disapproval evaluation for T-Mobile as a provider.	negative
I'm at complete capacity ! . ! . ! . ! . I contacted Symantec and they stated they don't know why but I should obtain technician's assistance at $35/hr to help ! . ! . I did contact them and was on hold for 55 minutes until I disconnected ! .	negative
also, some extra mp3 gadgets such as the nitrus allow you to play wma (windows media audio) tracks, whereas the ipod does not.	negative
nothing extraordinary is accomplished by internet protection or by malware prevention software.	negative
I discover this characteristic on this device pointless, but, since I don't truly require this function anyway, I don't particularly utilize it.	negative
once more, every evaluation penned about the tech line is accurate . . . after waiting nearly 45 minutes i ultimately conversed with a rep .	negative
i 'm presently utilizing a sony vaio s-150 ( which i purchased at the conclusion of this previous august ) , and it requires about five minutes just to start the system - in fact , i 've resorted to just hibernating , rather than powering down completely .	negative
but this doesn 't compensate for it 's countless other deficiencies , the largest of which is the incapacity to download any upgrades due to issues with liveupdate .	negative
The drawback is the dimension of the phone, it is large for today’s benchmark.	negative
I attempted deactivating the various elements provided with this product, paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service . . . and observed no enhancement .	negative
after 10 years, i now obtained mccaffee's product after reaching out to their assistance . . . . they replied promptly, and for no fee, and were incredibly beneficial .	negative
I completely detest Symantec. I swear, if I could have genuinely ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.	negative
I am an IT expert and have utilized Norton for years, but this product is a total and absolute flop.	negative
back in may 2004 , when i first evaluated this , it had taken me over 16 hours to set up and operate .	negative
the sole issue i encountered was a minor hiccup with t-mobile.	negative
this edition of internet protection 2004, is beyond despair.	negative
From day one, we've encountered hurdles, malfunctions, setbacks, ongoing restarts, prolonged outages due to "cc app.exe" application functioning which is a Norton program.	negative
I have discovered too many glitches in Norton Internet Security Professional to suggest it to anyone without immense patience and expertise.	negative
I rate it 4-stars solely because the setup procedure - or rather issues that may arise during the setup procedure - can be exasperating to the typical computer user.	negative
in summary - nokia themselves don 't recognize that this phone doesn 't function with the palm , and if you don 't take my counsel you will waste hours with technicians around the world reading from scripts , scolding you in fractured english for not adhering to their instructions precisely .	negative
the sole drawback i can consider is the absence of a mega-pixel camera .	negative
and if you 're a mac proprietor like me , they 've naturally guaranteed you have no viable alternative .	negative
during installation, nis would either hang or not restart properly when prompted to do so.	negative
I 've always enjoyed Symantec items, except for this edition 2004.	negative
one grievance . . . the display is too readily scratched ! .	negative
cons: no am/fm radio receiver -- something a significant number of rivals are doing	negative
Some of the heightened pitched sounds are very straightforward to perceive, but not easy to focus on.	negative
the finest thing to do with this edition, is to leave it on the store rack. it doesn 't function, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned cash.	negative
other objects that I yearn for are voice-activated calling and a standard 2.5 mm headphone jack.	negative
I believe it is a mixture of the application magnitude occupying resources and the open/close scanning that it performs with every application.	negative
when i buy software, i never wish to have to expend hours searching for answers to my installation issues -- in particular answers that entail manually configuring driver settings or altering the registry ! .	negative
this is certainly one of those items, particularly as the corporation is leaning more towards generating a gain.	negative
I presumed they had outstanding service, but their reception in my region (Los Angeles) is atrocious.	negative
I obtained this collection from Norton, and within moments my internet connection ceased and my PC was nearly lifeless due to registry issues from the download.	negative
likewise, their t-zones, although inexpensive ($4.99/month) never functions.	negative
the largest alert indicator for me was the fact that although my kin's rival was comparatively recent, it was filled with scratches.	negative
I 've explored the software and their virtual tech assistance ( useless ) and have discovered no remedies.	negative
they weren 't aware of what the issue might be .	negative
nevertheless, symantec has taken a considerable decline for the worse with this edition.	negative
the more delicate hues that were incorporated with the phone are difficult to perceive at times .	negative
then when I visited norton 's site to acquire a priority id number according to the directions I had been provided, I couldn 't locate a method to obtain one .	negative
it possesses a equalizer, but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more settings than the ipod.	negative
particularly, it wouldn't correspond.	negative
initially, allow me to mention that I received the 20gb ipod for christmas, and I probably would not have expended the $300 myself.	negative
subsequent to a recent enhancement, I can no longer reach more than 1 internet browser window.	negative
simply if we could acquire one lens in it . .	negative
you can " deactivate " some of the individual elements , but don 't be misled -- they 're still present and functioning .	negative
this is merely an issue at night, during the day the display is very simple to observe.	negative
avoid this item ! .	negative
you can 't accomplish that with a sony t610 ( which i exchanged for a 6600 ) .	negative
also if you do succeed in getting it set up, any issues with liveupdate or with system works will also impact the functionality and/or the procedure of refreshing internet security.	negative
- no voice activated calling ( what were they contemplating	negative
the one huge disappointment is that the phones made for t-mobile lack many of the choices and functions that a nokia directly from the creator should have.	negative
bell tones solely arrive with insane melodies and irritating chimes, there is merely one tone that appears near to a normal tone.	negative
their network range is very erratic, and the network always appears congested, resulting in very unpleasant calling experience.	negative
the sole issue is the dimension of the keys .	negative
I perused numerous evaluations on Norton I.S. 2004 from a range of sources (CNET, Amazon, message forums) and arrived at the conclusion that NIS 04 was a dreadful product and not worth the upgrade.	negative
I have reviewed the installation guidelines for both NIS 2004 and Navy 2004 before installation, but still ended up with the same outcome . . . worthless software .	negative
do not employ them, so I eliminate them for extra space.	negative
there is also no audio recording, something most if not all mp3 devices possess that the ipod doesn't.	negative
Furthermore, when I dial an "800" number such as an airline, it will not allow me to utilize numeric buttons to maneuver through the prerecorded menu.	negative
this is a dreadful corporation with a poor item and terrible assistance.	negative
what frustrates me the most is that a program like that is not inexpensive receives zero assistance from symantec, if you desire support, they 'll bill you a fee ! .	negative
but I had to give you four because the assistance for my brand-new ipod was horribly sluggish.	negative
the sole primary disadvantage is the reality that the voice-calling system is somewhat particular.	negative
they stated they would reimburse all the funds, but a month later, they inform me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its expense is solely handling and shipping - $15 to " manage " and ship a cd? . -- and they have been offended and combative on the phone and in emails.	negative
so noisy , truly , that it does n 't function terribly well as a mute ringer alternative .	negative
I am happy that I do not work for Norton.	negative
its metal backing captures fingerprints and scrapes easily, not excellent from a aesthetic standpoint.	negative
we can commence by shedding the glossy wonder-material coating that you can truly scratch just by gazing at it incorrectly, and thus eradicate the necessity for third-party "inquiring" protective cases for an additional thirty dollars.	negative
do not purchase any domestic edition of norton anything.	negative
one additional concern is that the headphone port is distinctive to nokia, so regular headphones will not function.	negative
since I obtained the device, I invested endless hours on the phone with customer support representatives who assured t-zones would operate " in 24 hours ".	negative
one additional thing, the standard ringtones that arrive with the phone are terrible.	negative
occasionally, numerous programs fail.	negative
2) smartphone is extremely slow.	negative
and , when you ponder about it , it 's offensive that norton mandates its clients to leap through these hoops -- anyone who can supply evidence of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is out ? . ) , should possess equal precedence .	negative
the menu appears after 3 seconds the image takes a while to load from its sluggish card memory.	negative
nevertheless, I am extremely disillusioned with this item and with Symantec.	negative
the client assistance is awful .	negative
its silent .	negative
- no exclusive headset port	negative
although almost a dozen various individuals at both t-mobile and nokia have informed me otherwise, it is merely not feasible to utilize this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and numerous other devices.	negative
At first look, I believed this phone was a tad too large for me, perhaps a bit too intricate.	negative
the other irritation with this that you have to eliminate every single trace of prior version of norton systemworks before you installs this .	negative
I notice various other criticisms that convey the same . . . . steer clear of Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone! .	negative
when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the myriad attributes , two transmission programs and multiple storage gadgets , dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to surpass .	negative
their website provides no live assistance whatsoever.	negative
I am uninterested with the silver appearance.	negative
if you possess an earlier edition of " online protection " installed , you might also need to eliminate it as well before continuing with systemworks installation .	negative
the sole issue i encountered was a couple of elements didn 't exactly load accurately upon startup , but a restart resolved the issue .	negative
it 's crucial that individuals are aware of the subsequent : first , the interface is sluggish .	negative
the moment finally came when i was certain i 'd depart sprint .	negative
you additionally need to enter and manually delete numerous symantec files from the registry.	negative
however, the primary issue that I believe is the with the audio quality.	negative
sacred calf ! . it genuinely does scratch smoothly ! .	negative
once it solidified so badly i couldn 't even utilize the power button to shut it off , and had to open and remove the battery .	negative
Aside from that, it is all the identical except the latest alterations.	negative
At times I 'm not capable of linking to the phone with isync through bluetooth but I discovered that restarting the phone appears to resolve this issue.	negative
I 'm an advocate of Nokia, but this gadget and the following models (7610) are seemingly a frantic effort at stuffing as much undercooked and experimental technologies in one reckless phone.	negative
caution ! . the windows " uninstall software " function does not perform an adequate job of this , and neither does norton's own deletion tool .	negative
who desires to spend $30 to talk about a flaw in a product that just cost $95 ? . ( i also purchased the back-up cd ) .	negative
my digits are somewhat short so it took a while to master how to strike a key without hitting the neighboring ones.	negative
there isn 't numerous traits on the ipod at all , except entertainments .	negative
We frequently faced "windows virtual memory low" error alerts appearing, accompanied by absurd slowdowns and/or crashes.	negative
it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service , even though i 'm operating a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year .	negative
The 6610 possesses the transmission function which is entirely meaningless.	negative
I experienced a lot of the same issues that everyone else has mentioned ( mainly the sluggish processor ), and then I couldn't remove the damn thing from my computer entirely ! .	negative
my sole complaint regarding the equipment is the instructions.	negative
this item has practically all the same setup issues.	negative
concerning pc application assistance nokia suite does not operate with certain editions of xp as i attempted to link my phone via infrared port on my notebook.	negative
only then did i discover the reality -- this device does not function with palm pdas ! .	negative
also, the battery's aren't user interchangeable.	negative
the 6600 will offer comparable service in more advanced regions of the states and not as effectively in more isolated areas .	negative
Basically, the 6600 is a compilation of over-valued features you don't and won't need (if you do, obtain a pda or pocket pc), none of them function as they should, and the basic phone capabilities and ergonomics are subpar.	negative
this model does possess the classic key configuration , it 's merely that they are very near to one another , and have unconventional forms , so it takes a significant adjustment for someone like me with large hands .	negative
secondly, in addition to the delay each time you issue a command, it's just not that easily usable on the go.	negative
their technical support isn’t useful either; they just read what’s on their site and bill you $50 (+ toll charges) to do it.	negative
The sole issue that I have discovered with the internet service is that it does not connect to mils (real estate broker software) very effectively at all.	negative
this was clearly a plot as it is bizarre in ' simple to fabricate a gadget with interchangeable batteries ! . ! .	negative
but those 2 arise every instance .	negative
nevertheless , in my opinion , $299 is a significant amount to spend for a gadget that will merely endure 18 months .	negative
they are not impressive capable good .	negative
I truly lament enrolling with T-Mobile, but I'm trapped with them for the next 6 months of the agreement.	negative
perhaps this novel design is more robust than the previous, but I somewhat question it.	negative
initiate, sign out, sign in . . . everything turned extremely sluggish .	negative
characteristics : honestly , there aren 't any characteristics , unless you consider the games a characteristic .	negative
you push the alert button on the front and it takes a moment of seconds to bring up the menu.	negative
the controls on the phone are tiny, even for my petite fingertips, but you acclimate to them rather swiftly.	negative
only con i can regard is no lens . . . .	negative
poor clarity on the controls.	negative
I could barely utilize it without a recharge in 2 days!	negative
merely don't get tempted into t-mobile's alluring rebate.	negative
one warning i have is that i comprehend the ipod does not store the pictures in such a manner that the quality of the image is maintained .	negative
for purposes of clarity, here is my critique from that item, modified to be suitable for this product, since, for the majority, they share many of the same issues.	negative
no in box accessories -- an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be pleasant , but nope . . . movable parts -- this makes me almost desire to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th ; . with movable parts , its easy to harm an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners ; . note the ipod mini doesn 't have movable parts and is made of titanium .	negative
the keys are near together , and the arrangement is a bit peculiar in relation to standard rectangular arrangement keypads , but it 's not too strange .	negative
I devoted hours arranging the stations ( accommodates about 13-14, I think ), although the reception is erratic.	negative
nevertheless , the battery longevity isn 't as great as i would prefer .	negative
initially, it critical, critical setup issues.	negative
purchase this if you enjoy cognitive challenges or experimenting with how to unlock locks.	negative
but it wouldn 't allow me to enable the av defense back on and it wouldn 't cease with the warnings .	negative
numerous users on a single machine never appeared to act like you 'd anticipate .	negative
this process can be very annoying and perilous when you are driving a manual gearbox on the freeway.	negative
the images in the contact list are dreadfully resized too ; . they appear as though they were constructed out of lego blocks .	negative
no issues now, just a feeble disillusionment in the manner Norton has forsaken their patrons.	negative
I find the absence of amusing games on this device quite unsettling.	negative
If you have no previous iteration of Norton security on your system, or Norton antivirus, the installation will continue seamlessly; otherwise, dig thoroughly and execute a significant registry cleanup! The outdated programs will leave a mark that will interfere with the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.	negative
