iTunes, a program typically preferred by those with a Mac over those with a PC, has a love-hate relationship with users. However, depending on your computer expertise, using this program could be difficult as it is necessary for an iPod.	positive
Thanks to the included software bundle, transferring files couldn't be easier.	positive
As good as the optical zoom does, the digital zoom takes pictures!	positive
The best thing I have ever used is the i-pod.	positive
The positive features while I had the phone included good sound quality and an excellent FM phone and earpiece.	positive
Cleaning it is very easy.	positive
Reception, visibility, and interface are great (although they may be complicated by others).	positive
Turning on my black one for the first time and charging it, the blue light looked so cool.	positive
With 20gb instead of 5, you get all the " cool " features of the mini.	positive
Really great, this one is.	positive
With some incredible range, it is easy and truly effective.	positive
By the way, my only Hitachi tool, I have yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi, and honestly, I don't know if I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.	positive
This has got to be the one if you have to buy a camera on a budget.	positive
Using my Apple PowerBook as my modem, I connect to the phone via Bluetooth!	positive
A blessing in the player is having a tuner, fm tuner & microphone.	positive
I especially enjoy the " txt " file that documents all the control information for the pictures you capture.	positive
Light compact, a nice little phone.	positive
It is well made and friendly to the user.	positive
A positive aspect of having a color screen is just like the polyphonic ringtones.	positive
With a minimum of fuss, it works.	positive
Receiving the packaging that contained all the accessories ( desk stand/hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc ) was lucky for me.	positive
It has all.	positive
Perfectly timed, it seems that I have discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro this year.	positive
On the internet, there is an open-source firmware with numerous additional features.	positive
My purchase has not disappointed me.	positive
My installation experience was quite good.	positive
The micro adjustment knob and collet work well too, indicating that it is well made.	positive
Overall, establishing a connection was not difficult if one is familiar with the basic steps to take, and the software excelled in creating a connection.	positive
The fine is just sound.	positive
Loaded into it were a lot of photos that display very clearly for such a small screen, and, crucially, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous.	positive
If it weren't for the fact that I prefer using my 3330 to do all the most common things one does with a phone, I would have given this phone 5 stars.	positive
To install it, you don't have to be a tech junkie, just be able to put a CD in the computer and follow the instructions.	positive
While in the same room, I got 54mps pertaining to the speed issue.	positive
By far the best diaper pail is diaper champ!	positive
I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system, as a very economical person- I never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills.	positive
After some emails and postal exchanges, I had a new zen and the good news is that the creative support is very responsive.	positive
The Zen Micro was chosen over the iPod mini, despite both having their own positives and negatives, as I am not an apple person and have never been one - I desired something fully compatible with Windows Media Player.	positive
In my opinion, focusing on what you need now is key. This product boasts an outstanding range, a steady connection that has not dropped once in over a month of use.	positive
If it works really good, get a wireless router.	positive
The supplied headphones are better than the mediocre iPod buds, hands-down.	positive
Just over 200 bucks was what I was able to find one online for (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space - no offense to Amazon.	positive
A USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in are included in the package.	positive
For nearly two hours, I used the speakerphone and the battery didn't even go down one single bar.	positive
I still don't see a problem with my computer getting slow or crashing, even when working on Word, Explorer, Netscape, Acrobat Reader, and Photoshop at the same time and using a lot of memory.	positive
I have used about 6 GB on my iPod so far, totaling well over 1000 songs, all of which play at near-cd quality as far as I know.	positive
They must work well when provided with the hard case.	positive
With everything I need, I am satisfied as long as this mp3 player lasts me a good three years.	positive
Buy it now if you are a picture fanatic like me and consider yourself picky - this camera will not let you down!	positive
The package includes an AC charger, a hard shell with a clip and a stand adapter. It can be easily transported as it is smaller than a pack of smokes. Also included is a USB cable. The appearance is snazzy.	positive
Odor free for at least 15 months is the champ.	positive
For those emergency pics you have to have, I recommend two rechargeable batteries or an alkaline backup, although battery life is good.	positive
I have to admit, it's not the best looking phone ever, but it has this look of static and absolute conviction that resembles everything a phone should be.	positive
Over the years, a very well made product has worked very well for me.	positive
Inside this unit are packed extra features, including an FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock, that most will hardly ever use.	positive
Smooth, powerful, and with a proven track record, it may be affordable.	positive
Such is the incredible clarity that you can almost cram the entire 2.5!	positive
This mp3 is very cool, I must say.	positive
Have I mentioned how awesome and polyphonic the included ringtones are?	positive
The phone has experienced no problems.	positive
It's simple to also empty out.	positive
Most of the phones out there are outperformed by the battery.	positive
Since 1993, I have owned some kind of creative audio product and never had to call tech support.	positive
A big beast of a router is Hitachi's M12V.	positive
Just a neat bonus is the extra spare battery.	positive
Working great, the movie mode is also.	positive
As easy to use as the mini without any firmware download is mine.	positive
Now able to, with a 1gb MMC upgrade for this phone:	positive
Hoping for creative to hit a home run here, I think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double.	positive
I was able to streamline performance and get to a live person within a couple of minutes to help me tweak a couple of the settings by placing a call to customer support.	positive
1. Use the Phillips camcorder pro to record approximately 1 hour of video.	positive
Loading within a few seconds is no big deal with a couple hundred contacts on the menu.	positive
In the router logs, there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets compared to my old dlink router.	positive
It was disappointing that it broke after only 6 months of having it.	positive
The Creative MediaSource organizer and player software, which I originally had with the Audigy ZS sound card, is something that I am quite partial to; it is definitely an added plus.	positive
I believe the champ is the best way to go, regardless of this fact.	positive
Experiencing photography on a totally new level was made possible by this fantastic, very compact camera!	positive
Easy to learn and affordable, this camera produced spectacular images.	positive
The best is the diaper champ!	positive
- reception of outstanding signal	positive
Will you be using this phone to play airplane? It's not the most rugged one ever.	positive
This small camera makes me really happy.	positive
Superb is the quality.	positive
Included in the Nokia PC Suite software is the excellent pc sync feature, which can be utilized with a data cable or infrared port or bluetooth.	positive
It's still loved by us!	positive
A decent extension of the smart phone line is the Nokia 6600.	positive
A unit that is excellent for diaper disposal.	positive
For more than a year, it is completely reliable.	positive
Stylish and versatile.	positive
The recorder is fine, as is the sound quality, with great fm tuner.	positive
I would buy the router again, and am very pleased with it.	positive
By simply connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable, you can charge the battery.	positive
The Bluetooth is loved by me; it is easy for use with a wireless abra headset.	positive
For an enthusiastic amateur photographer, this camera is perfect.	positive
Accompanying it is a 32mb mmc card with a built-in phone memory of over 6mb!	positive
With auto, manual, and the very helpful "scene" mode, there are endless possibilities available, offering 11 optimized situational settings like portrait, landscape, beach/snow, sunset etc.	positive
Staying with Sprint, I worry that their customer service isn't nearly as good as T-Mobile's, but their reception clarity is exceptional.	positive
A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip is the freebies you receive, something very handy and useful.	positive
The photos, pretty darned good they are!	positive
The height adjustment, while functional, is not perfect.	positive
This baby really teamed up on Nokia and T-Mobile.	positive
Less than 12 hours is how long the battery lasts.	negative
I am quite disturbed by the lack of entertaining games on this phone.	negative
Navigating takes up so much time that it would drive you crazy eventually.	negative
After installation, neither of these Norton products work, but if I installed either one.	negative
I am stuck with T-Mobile for the next 6 months of the contract, and I am really regretting signing up with them.	negative
The phone's volume level is not all that good.	negative
Simply reading what is on their website and charging you $50 (plus toll fees) to do it is what they do, without providing helpful technical service.	negative
Be sure not to buy this product under any circumstances.	negative
The second time around was worse, unbelievable, when I did it.	negative
Receiving the 20gb iPod for Christmas, I must first say that I highly doubt I would have spent $300 on it myself.	negative
Text messaging can be a real pain for those who are fond of small buttons.	negative
Every twenty seconds (literally), alerts started popping up while I was trying to play Half Life 2, warning me that my antivirus protection was off.	negative
Attempting to connect my phone via the infrared port on my laptop, I found that Nokia Suite does not support some versions of XP in terms of PC software.	negative
In October 2004, the firewall notified me that I could no longer install any software to access the internet due to its full capacity.	negative
Get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate, not just.	negative
The phone will only work through T-Mobile's services for its internet functions - wap and gprs. They have removed the menu options that would allow you to configure the phone for use on a different network.	negative
Except games, there are hardly any features on the iPod.	negative
Unfortunately, the 6610 lacks voice dialing like my previous phone, but the other features it offers make up for this downside.	negative
I am excited to be dropping AT&T eagerly after several years of torture from their customer service, and I am transferring our other 3 family phones from AT&T to T-Mobile in August 2004!	negative
Similarly, the use of number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu is not permitted when attempting to call an "800" number such as that of an airline.	negative
Beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with extended the problems I had installing Norton.	negative
One would tend to type something instead of the actual letters, so there will be much erasing of text.	negative
The phones produced for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have, which is a huge disappointment.	negative
Almost from the beginning, liveupdate would not function.	negative
If there was a zero-star rating, I would give it.	negative
Hearing from the earpiece can be challenging in a noisy environment.	negative
After using it for about a week, the screen began freezing on me.	negative
My ad/pop-up blocking was then completely gone.	negative
This release is absolutely not ready for the product.	negative
Due to its looks and durability, the minimalist white interface is favored by many people.	negative
Only for old people, this phone may not be suitable for fast people.	negative
Crazy songs and annoying rings with ring tones are all there is, with just one ring that sounds close to a regular ring.	negative
Something was already wrong, I knew, as many of the spam I had seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.	negative
The back of the iPod has a chrome finish, which makes this surface prone to scratches.	negative
Appearing one at a time on the whole screen, the menu options require scrolling down one by one or having memorized their order in the menu to select them using the number keypad.	negative
All the same except for the new updates, everything is different.	negative
Cons are easily broken.	negative
The menu sometimes appears after a second or two when buttons are pressed.	negative
Using the small buttons on the sides is sloppy and they are bulky.	negative
After waiting for an hour or more, I finally received a free support number for Norton from my USP support staff.	negative
It disappoints me the most that a software like that isn't cheap and doesn't receive any support from symantec, they will charge you a fee if you want support!	negative
Having to uninstall all remnants of the previous version of Norton SystemWorks before installing this one is quite annoying.	negative
There is an option to view photos with a 20 gb photo iPod for an extra $20.	negative
I was unable to re-enable the AV protection and the alerts just wouldn't cease.	negative
One downside I have found with this phone is its tendency to react slowly, such as taking a while to load when I press the contacts button. This delay is consistent across almost all the menus and programs on the phone.	negative
Norton online support neither acknowledges this problem, nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.	negative
These people find processing rebate forms requires less effort.	negative
Starting by getting rid of the shiny miracle-material cover that can be scratched just by looking at it wrong can eliminate the necessity for third-party "asking" protective covers for an additional thirty dollars.	negative
That the OS the phone runs on does have a few issues, I will say.	negative
It's a bit disappointing, unfortunately!	negative
For the past 5 years, I have been using Norton and over the last 2 years, the software has become increasingly disgraceful.	negative
*	negative
Stripping down the product to just the anti-virus service, I attempted to disable its various components... and saw no improvements.	negative
Once again proven wrong, I had the idea that it was an all-in-one. Excelling at nothing, this phone is less than average in everything. If you are in serious need of any of the "other than phone" functionalities, you will be disappointed. If you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets, then fine, but don't expect to get much done.	negative
Now, the only thing left is a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned their customers, with no problems to be found.	negative
Accessing mils (real estate broker software) is the only issue I have found with the internet service, as it does not work very well at all.	negative
Using the web browser causes the battery power to discharge rapidly.	negative
Disconnecting you from the internet, this program certainly protects your computer.	negative
Every time those 2 come up.	negative
I emailed the online tech support with that simple question, but their response was entirely unhelpful (it seemed like they didn't even bother reading the email and just sent a few generic paragraphs back).	negative
After nearly 45 minutes of waiting, I finally spoke to a rep, confirming the truth behind every review written about the tech line.	negative
It only worked properly for many a month when I finally got it working.	negative
I faced several of the same issues mentioned by others (mainly the slow processor), and then I found myself unable to fully eliminate the darn thing from my computer!	negative
Serious installation problems can arise first.	negative
The device features a stock tracking app ( which is equally useless ) and an app that converts different metrics ( like currency, length, area, etc ) and is somewhat helpful.	negative
One more thing, the default ringtones that come with the phone are terrible.	negative
Beyond hope is this version of internet security 2004.	negative
Paying $299 for a device that will only last 18 months is, in my opinion, a lot.	negative
Bringing my modern pc with lots of speed and memory to a halt, this firewall did.	negative
Dealing with computers, especially Windows -- ugh . . ., can be quite annoying.	negative
Neither is the user support service great.	negative
Without extreme patience and experience, I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to anyone.	negative
Arrived finally was the day when I was sure I'd leave Sprint.	negative
Before the systemworks install can proceed, you may need to also remove any older version of "internet security" that is installed.	negative
Remember the battery statement I made earlier while listening to this one - terrible customer service.	negative
After enduring years with the carrier's expensive plans and terrible customer service, portability seemed heaven-sent.	negative
Of any of the major companies, they have the worst service.	negative
Its innumerable other short-comings, however, do not make up for it, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate.	negative
The 6610's radio function is utterly pointless.	negative
Mostly lows are to the 2004 edition, but there are some highs.	negative
I find myself at full capacity! After contacting Symantec, they claimed to have no idea why and recommended getting tech support at a rate of $35/hr. When I tried to reach them, I was put on hold for 55 minutes before deciding to hang up!	negative
As of October 2004, I am prepared to request a refund from Symantec due to the fact that these products have not been functioning.	negative
Superficially, a concern is the battery issue, but when the time comes, any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one (based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement').	negative
Advocating for Nokia, this phone and the subsequent models (7610), appear to be a desperate attempt to cram as many under-engineered and experimental technologies into one messy phone.	negative
It is a rare feature to have no memory stick slots, but extra storage would be nice. The built-in lithium battery is a huge hassle to bring back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient.	negative
While the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory, the menu pops up after 3 seconds.	negative
If you enjoy mental challenges or attempting to learn how to pick locks, then consider purchasing this.	negative
The battery, in addition, appears to not last more than eight to ten hours, and a complete charge can take up to four hours.	negative
Constantly, I hear a high-pitched distorted sound, the volume does not seem to be loud enough.	negative
Whenever connecting to get updates, it failed first.	negative
- lacking a proprietary headset jack	negative
It was uncertain to them what the problem could be.	negative
Should the MS Money database be scanned when the program is closed?	negative
The program scan feature appears to have not located the exe file for Outlook!	negative
This phone does not work on bluetooth.	negative
The most significant problem is installation.	negative
My favorite has always been Symantec products, except for this version 2004.	negative
The metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky and scratches very easily, which is another thing you should know.	negative
To get help with installation problems, go to symantec's website. Choose the support tab, then select 'home or home office support' to use an automated support assistant. This assistant is able to scan the norton program files on your computer, find any issues, and offer advice on how to resolve them.	negative
One of the more buggy implementations is Norton Internet Security 2004.	negative
