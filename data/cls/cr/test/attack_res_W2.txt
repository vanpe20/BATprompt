itunes -- this is a love-hate relationship program ; usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod .	positive
transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.	positive
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures as the optical zoom does !	positive
i-pod is the best thing i have ever used.	positive
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .	positive
it is very easy to clean.	positive
great reception, visibility, and interface.	positive
looks and shape : i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on the blue light looked so cool .	positive
the " cool " features of the mini, but with 20gb instead of 5.	positive
this one is great.	positive
It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.	positive
i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder.	positive
if you have to buy a camera on a budget, this has got to be the one.	positive
i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book !	positive
fm tuner & microphone : having a tuner in the player is a blessing.	positive
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.	positive
nice little phone . . . light compact . .	positive
well made and user friendly	positive
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones.	positive
it works with a minimum of fuss.	positive
i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories ( desk stand/hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc ) .	positive
it has it all.	positive
this year, it seems that i choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro.	positive
there is an open-source firmware on the net with tons of extra features.	positive
i have not been disappointed with my purchase.	positive
my experience with installation was good	positive
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.	positive
Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.	positive
the sound is just fine.	positive
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous.	positive
i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.	positive
you do not have to be a tech junkie to install it , just put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .	positive
pertaining to the speed issue: i got 54mps while i was in the same room.	positive
diaper champ is the best diaper pail !	positive
being a very economical person, i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills.	positive
the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen .	positive
while all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person - i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player .	positive
my opinion is concentrate on what you need now, this product has excellent range, holds a teddy connection, has even drooped one and I have it for more than a month now.	positive
if you need a wireless router . . . . get it get it get it . . . . works really good . . . .	positive
the supplied headphones are better than the ipod buds.	positive
no offense to amazon, but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks, and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.	positive
the package comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they 're okay until you get a better pair ) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in .	positive
I've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar.	positive
i work on word, explorer, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time, but still dont see a problem with computer.	positive
i have about 6 gb used on my ipod ( well over 1000 songs ) , and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near-cd quality .	positive
the case they give with it must work well.	positive
this is the mp3 player with everything i need. as long as it lasts me a good three years, i'm satisfied.	positive
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down . now buy it !	positive
+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes +ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +usb cable	positive
the champ is odor free for at least 15 months.	positive
battery life is good , recommend two rechargeable , alkaline backup , emergency pics .	positive
i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be	positive
a well made product that has worked well for me over the years.	positive
there are extra features packed inside this unit such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock.	positive
it is smooth, powerful, affordable & has a proven track record.	positive
the clarity is unbelievable, you can cram almost the full 2, 5 !	positive
i must say . . . this mp3 is very cool.	positive
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?	positive
i have had no problems with the phone.	positive
It's easy to empty out.	positive
the battery is better than most phones out there.	positive
i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.	positive
hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router.	positive
the spare battery is a neat bonus	positive
the movie mode is also working great	positive
mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.	positive
i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can :	positive
metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .	positive
a call to customer support helped me tweak the settings to streamline performance.	positive
record around 1 hour of video with phillips camcorder.	positive
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds.	positive
there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router	positive
wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.	positive
i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; . it is definitely an added plus .	positive
i believe the champ is the best way to go.	positive
A fantastic compact camera that made us experience photography on a new level!	positive
this camera was affordable, easy to learn, and produces spectacular images.	positive
the diaper champ is the best !	positive
- outstanding signal reception	positive
this isn't the most rugged phone ever but then you're not gonna play airplane with this, are you.	positive
really happy with this camera.	positive
the quality is superb	positive
The pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ).	positive
and we still love it !	positive
the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line.	positive
excellent diaper disposal unit.	positive
for more than a year , it is totally reliable .	positive
versatile and stylish.	positive
sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder.	positive
i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.	positive
another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable.	positive
i love the bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless abra headset.	positive
this camera is perfect for an amateur photographer.	positive
aside from a 6mb++ built-in phone memory , there 's a 32mb mmc card that goes with it !	.
aside from a built-in phone memory , there 's a mmc card that goes with it ! .	positive
the possibilities with auto, manual, and the very helpful "scene" mode, which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait, landscape, beach/snow, sunset etc., are endless.	positive
freebies you get : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , very handy and useful.	positive
photos are pretty good !	positive
the height adjustment works well- not perfect.	positive
nokia and t-mobile teamed up well on this baby.	positive
the battery does not last 12 hours	negative
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing.	negative
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.	negative
if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ?	negative
i regret signing up with t-mobile, stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.	negative
the volume level of the phone is not all that good.	negative
their technical service isn't helpful; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 to do it.	negative
Avoid this product.	negative
i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .	negative
first, let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas, and i most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.	negative
4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain if one is fond of text messaging.	negative
while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with " alerts " every twenty seconds , warning me my antivirus protection was off .	negative
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop.	negative
in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn't anymore software to use the internet because its full .	negative
just don't get drawn into t-mobile's catchy rebate.	negative
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network.	negative
There isn't much features on the iPod, except games.	negative
unfortunately, the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone, but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming.	negative
after years of torture by at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! .	negative
also , when i dial an " 800 " number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu.	negative
the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with	negative
there will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.	negative
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have.	negative
from the beginning, liveupdate would not function.	negative
if there was a zero-star rating i would give it	negative
In a noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.	negative
after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me .	negative
my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.	negative
this product is not ready for release.	negative
looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.	negative
this phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.	negative
ring tones come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .	negative
i knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products .	negative
the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches.	negative
menu options appear one at a time, taking up the whole screen, and one has to scroll down one by one, or have memorized where they are in the menu order, to select them by using the number keypad.	negative
other than that it is all the same except the new updates.	negative
cons breaks easily.	negative
sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.	negative
2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use.	negative
i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice .	negative
what disappoints me most is that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a fee!	negative
the annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this.	negative
There is no photo viewing option. However, there is a 20 gb photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.	negative
but it wouldn't let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.	negative
the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.	negative
norton online support does not acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.	negative
these people takes effort to process rebate forms.	negative
we can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can scratch just by looking at it wrong, and eliminate the need for third-party protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.	negative
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues.	negative
disappoint on that !	negative
i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful.	negative
*	negative
i tried disabling the components provided with this product, paring it back to anti-virus service . . . and saw no improvement.	negative
my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the " other than phone " functionalists , you 'll be disappointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done .	negative
no problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers.	negative
the problem i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) well.	negative
the battery power discharges rapidly on using the web browser.	negative
yeah - this program protects your computer - by locking you off the internet.	negative
but those 2 come up every time.	negative
i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs).	negative
every review written about the tech line is true . . . after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep.	negative
when i got it working , it only worked properly for many a month .	negative
i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed, and then i couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!	negative
first , it serious , serious installation problems.	negative
it also has a stock tracking app built in and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics.	negative
one more thing, the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible.	negative
this version of internet security 2004 is beyond hope	negative
in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months.	negative
i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt.	negative
this is annoying , but from working with computers ( especially windows -- ugh . . . )	negative
the user support service isn't too great either.	negative
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.	negative
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint.	negative
customer service : awful . remember the battery statement i made earlier .	negative
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent	.
New text: after years with carrier expensive plans horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .	negative
they have the worst service of any of the major companies.	negative
but this doesn't make up for its innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate.	negative
the 6610 has the radio function which is useless.	negative
there are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostly lows.	negative
im at full capacity! called syman tic and they said they don't know why but i should get tech's support at $35/hr to help! i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up!	negative
as of october , 2004 , these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symantec .	negative
the battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a google search for 'ipod battery replacement').	negative
i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .	negative
no memory stick slots -- a rare feature , extra storage , not that it needs it built-in lithium battery -- a huge hassle to bring this back ; . draining the battery once you get it helps , but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient	negative
the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.	negative
buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks	negative
in addition , i do not think the battery lasts more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge .	negative
i do hear a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .	negative
first , it failed whenever connecting to get updates.	negative
- no proprietary headset jack	negative
they didn't know what the problem could be.	negative
Is it necessary to scan my Money database when I close the program?	negative
"scan" feature did not find the exe file for outlook !	negative
bluetooth does not work on this phone.	negative
the biggest problem is the installation.	negative
i've always liked symantec products, except for this version 2004.	negative
another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.	negative
if you experience problems with installation, visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.	negative
norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.	negative
