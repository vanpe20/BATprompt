The penalty is only noise.	positive

After some communication via emails and mail, I gained a fresh perspective and am happy to report that the creative assistance is highly attentive.	positive
I opted for the Zen Micro instead of the iPod mini, despite both having their own pros and cons, because I am not a supporter of Apple products and have never been one - I desired something that is compatible with Windows Media Player.	positive

If it functions very well, consider purchasing a wireless router.	positive
The provided headphones are superior to the average iPod earbuds, no question.	positive

This infant really joined forces with Nokia and T-Mobile.	positive
The battery does not endure for more than 12 hours.	negative
I am very bothered by the absence of fun games on this phone.	negative
Navigating through life consumes so much time that it could eventually lead to insanity.	negative
If any of these Norton products are added post-installation, they will not work.	negative
I have made a commitment to T-Mobile for the next six months, and I am disappointed that I chose to sign up with them.	negative
The phone's sound quality is not particularly satisfying.	negative
Merely reviewing the information on their site and then billing you $50 (plus toll fees) for it is their practice, all without offering useful technical assistance.	negative
Be sure not to buy this product under any circumstances.	negative
The next time I attempted it, it was even more terrible, nearly inconceivable.	negative
Getting the 20gb iPod as a Christmas gift, I have to admit that I don't think I would have bought it for $300 on my own.	negative
Those who like small buttons might have difficulty with text messaging.	negative
Alerts began appearing every twenty seconds (literally) as I attempted to play Half Life 2, informing me that my antivirus protection was disabled.	negative

Be captivated by T-Mobile's attractive discount, not just.	negative

Apart from games, there are hardly any additional features available on the iPod.	negative
Unfortunately, the 6610 does not offer voice dialing similar to my previous phone, but the other functions it offers make up for this limitation.	negative

Similarly, using number keys to navigate the pre-recorded menu when calling an "800" number such as an airline's is also prohibited.	negative
The issues I faced when attempting to install Norton exceeded what symantec should reasonably anticipate the public to manage.	negative
Making errors in typing with the wrong letters will likely result in needing to frequently delete the text.	negative
The phones made for t-mobile do not have several of the menus and features that a nokia directly from the manufacturer should possess, which is very disappointing.	negative
Liveupdate would not work properly from the start.	negative
If a rating of zero stars could be given, that is what I would give.	negative
Listening through the earpiece can be difficult in a loud setting.	negative
After using it for a week, the screen began to freeze on me.	negative
My ad/pop-up blocking had vanished entirely.	negative
This version is definitely not prepared for the product.	negative
Many individuals prefer the minimalist white interface because of its appearance and long-lasting quality.	negative
This phone might not be appropriate for people who require quick mobility, but is perfect for the elderly.	negative
The sounds that can be heard are limited to unconventional music and bothersome phone ringtones, with only one ringtone that resembles a standard ring.	negative
I already sensed that something was amiss, given that a lot of the spam I had come across in the previous six months was coming from individuals who resell Norton products.	negative
The back of the iPod is coated in chrome, which leaves it vulnerable to scratches.	negative

Everything is different now except for the most recent changes.	negative
Cons can be broken easily.	negative

Using the bulky buttons on the edges is messy and they are big.	negative
After enduring an hour or longer, I ultimately got a complimentary helpline for Norton from my internet service provider's support team.	negative
It is a great disappointment for me that this software is costly and does not have the backing of symantec; you will be required to pay a fee for assistance if required!	negative
It can be frustrating to have to delete all traces of the prior version of Norton SystemWorks before installing the new one.	negative
You have the choice to see images using a 20 gb photo iPod for an additional $20.	negative
I was unable to re-enable the AV protection and the alerts were incessant.	negative
I have noticed a drawback of this phone is its tendency to respond sluggishly, for example, it takes a long time to load when I tap the contacts button. This lag is present in nearly all the menus and applications on the phone.	negative
Norton online support and the computer company that put it on our new computer are not recognizing this issue.	negative
These individuals discover that dealing with rebate forms requires less energy.	negative
By eliminating the glossy, miracle-material cover that can be easily damaged, there is no necessity to purchase additional third-party protective covers for an added thirty dollars.	negative
I have to confess that the phone's operating system does experience a couple of issues.	negative
It's a little unsatisfying, sadly!	negative
I have utilized Norton for the past 5 years, and the program has become increasingly unsatisfactory in the last 2 years.	negative
*.	negative
Attempting to disable the different components of the product and focus solely on the anti-virus service did not result in any improvements.	negative
My initial assumption that it was an all-in-one device has once again been proven wrong. This phone is mediocre in every aspect and does not excel in any specific area. Those seeking advanced features beyond basic phone functions will be disappointed. If you purchased this phone solely for the latest technology and have the budget for it, then it may suit your needs. However, do not anticipate being able to accomplish much with it.	negative
Now, all that remains is a sad feeling of letdown in how Norton has neglected their clients, with no issues to be seen.	negative
The sole issue I have faced with the internet service is trying to access mils (real estate broker software), which does not work efficiently.	negative
The battery drains quickly when utilizing the web browser.	negative
This program does indeed safeguard your computer by disconnecting you from the internet.	negative
Each time those two arise.	negative
I contacted the online technical support team with a basic inquiry, but the reply I got was not useful (it appeared as if they didn't even bother to go through my email and just sent a few standard paragraphs).	negative
After waiting for almost 45 minutes, I eventually talked to a representative who verified the accuracy of every review that had been written about the technical support line.	negative
It took several months before I could finally get it functioning correctly.	negative
I faced similar issues as others (specifically the slow processor), and then I had a difficult time getting rid of it from my computer entirely!	negative
Serious installation issues may occur initially.	negative
The device comes with a stock monitoring application ( which is equally ineffective ) and a tool for converting different measurements ( like currency, distance, area, etc ) which is moderately helpful.	negative
The pre-set ringtones that are included with the phone are not good.	negative
This edition of internet security 2004 goes beyond being hopeful.	negative
Paying $299 for a device that will only endure for 18 months is, in my view, quite expensive.	negative
This firewall made my modern computer, which is fast and has high memory, stop working.	negative
Dealing with computers, particularly Windows - ugh . . ., can be extremely frustrating.	negative
The user support service is also not outstanding.	negative
I have encountered too many problems with Norton Internet Security Professional to suggest it to anyone, unless they have a lot of patience and expertise.	negative
Finally came the day when I was certain I would depart from Sprint.	negative
Before moving forward with the systemworks installation, you may need to remove any existing "internet security" program that is currently installed on your device.	negative
Remember the earlier mention about the battery when considering this - terrible customer service.	negative
After suffering through years of pricey plans and awful customer service from the carrier, portability felt like a gift from above.	negative
Their service is the poorest out of all the leading companies.	negative
Its numerous other deficiencies, however, are not offset by the inability to download any updates because of issues with liveupdate.	negative
The radio feature of the 6610 serves no practical purpose.	negative
The 2004 version is mainly characterized by drawbacks, although there are also a few benefits.	negative
I am currently operating at maximum capacity! Symantec was unable to explain the issue and suggested seeking tech support for $35 per hour. I attempted to contact them but ended up waiting on hold for 55 minutes before giving up!	negative
I am prepared to request a refund from Symantec starting in October 2004 due to the fact that these products are not functioning.	negative
A possible concern is the battery problem, but when needed, any competent solder-jockey (like myself :-) can easily install a new one (using the abundant information found through a search for 'ipod battery replacement').	negative
Backing Nokia, this phone and the subsequent models (7610), appear to be a final attempt to cram several immature and unproven technologies into one disorganized phone.	negative
It is rare to not have memory stick slots, but having additional storage would be appreciated. Recharging the internal lithium battery can be problematic; it can be helpful to drain the battery when it is not in use, but having removable/replaceable batteries is much more convenient.	negative
It takes some time for the image to load due to its slow card memory, but the menu appears after 3 seconds.	negative
Think about purchasing this if you enjoy solving puzzles in your mind or are interested in testing your skills at picking locks.	negative
The battery seems to have a cap of eight to ten hours for its lifespan, and it could require up to four hours for a complete recharge.	negative
I often hear a quiet squeak that doesn't seem to be very loud.	negative
Whenever attempting to receive updates, it initially was unsuccessful.	negative
- lacking a specialized headphone port	negative
They were unsure of what could be the issue.	negative
Is it required to scan the MS Money database when the program is closed?	negative
The program's scanning feature appears to have been unsuccessful in locating the exe file for Outlook!	negative
This device is not compatible with bluetooth.	negative
The main concern is the setup.	negative
I have always preferred Symantec products, with the exception of the 2004 version.	negative
The metal on the rear of the iPod is fairly inexpensive and susceptible to scratches, something else you should keep in mind.	negative
For help with installation problems, go to the symantec website. Select the support section and pick 'home or home office support' to use an automated support assistant. This assistant will check the norton program files on your device, detect any issues, and offer advice on how to resolve them.	negative
Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the implementations that is susceptible to bugs.	negative
