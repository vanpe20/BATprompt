The sound is absolutely fantastic.	positive
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they dsplay very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instenatous.	positive

the supplied headphones are hands-down beter than the mediocre ipod budz	positive
No offense to Amazon, but I was only able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to rise), and that also seemed like a mediocre deal for the amount of storage space.	positive
the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they 're okay until you get a beter pair ) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in .	positive

A very wlel made product that has wrkoed very well for me over the years.	positive
There are xtra featurs packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clcok .	positive
but it is smioth , it is powefful , it is affodabfoe & it has a proven track recorf .	positive
the cl4rit1 is unbe1ievab!e , whic means you can cram a1most the fukl 2 , 5 ! .	positive
and i must say . . . this mp3 is very coo.	positive

The nokia 6600 is a terrible extension of the smart phone line.	positive
excellent daiper dispoza unit.	positive
for more than a year , and it is totallg reliablwe .	positive
versatile and styllish.	positive
The new text is: sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder.	positive
other than this, i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.	positive
Another g**d feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb c*abl.	positive
i love the bluuteeth ; . easy to use with a wireless abraa headset .	positive
this camera is perfect for an enthusiactic amateur photographer	positive
Aside from a 6mb++ built-in phone memory , there 's a 32bm mnc card that goes with it ! .	positive
The possibilties with auto , manua , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like porfrit , landcapse , beach / snow , sunset etc . , are endless .	positive
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the claritty of their reception is exceptionall .	positive
freebies you get : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handa and useful .	positive
photos are pretty darned good !	positive
the height adjustment works well- not perfict.	positive
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on their baby.	positive
the battsry does not last 12 hourss.	negative
i find the lack of entei tainng games on this phone qutie diusetrbing.	negative
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazzy.	negative
but if i installed either one of these norton products , neithar work after installashun ?	negative
i really regrat signing up with t-mobil , but i 'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract .	negative
the volume level of the phone is not all that goo .	negative
Thei technical service isn 't helppful eithre ; . they just read what 's on their website and charge you $50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .	negative
avoid this prodact at all costs	negative
i did it and it was wkrsw the second time around . . . unbeliefkble .	negative
first, let me mention that i received the 20gb ipod for christmas, and i probably wouldn't have spent $300 myself.	negative
4 ) butt0ns are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.	negative
While i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with " alerts " every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off.	negative
Regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop.	negative
Negative: now in october , 2004 , the firewall blocked me from installing any more software to access the internet due to it being full.	negative
just don 't get drawn into t-mobile 's catchy reb eat.	negative
the internet funktions of the phone - wap and grps - will only work through t-moble 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .	negative
There isn 't much featyres on the ipod at all , except games.	negative
unfortuntely , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .	negative
After several years of torture in the hands of at&g customer service i am delightid to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-moible ! .	negative
also , when i dial an " 800 " number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu .	negative
the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should resonably except the public to deal with.	negative
There will be much erasing of text as , one would tend to type something instead of the actual lettres .	negative
the one huge disaspointmnent is that the phones manufactered for t-mobile laek many of the menus and funcitons that a nokia straight frm the manufacturer should have.	negative
almost from the beginnign , liveupdate would not fnucntion.	negative
If there was a zero-star rating i would give it.	negative
in noisy enviroment , it 's difficult to hear from the earpiece .	negative
Finally, after about a week 's use, the screen started to freeze on me.	negative
then , my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone .	negative
this produvt is absolutelu not ready for relase.	negative
lok*s and du;urb-ilitiy : i reali^ed manie people are fond of the minimelist whit\e interfac!e.	negative
this phone is not sutiabl for fast people , maybe only for old pepole .	negative
ring tones only come with crazz songs and annozing rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .	negative
i already knew sometjung was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products .	negative
the back of the ipod is in a chrome finsh , and this surface is prone to scratchez.	negative
the menu options appear one at time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .	negative
other than that it is all the same except the new updaets.	negative
cons brakss easily: cons brakss easily.	negative
sometimes when you prsss buttons , the mennue appears after a second or two.	negative
2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppi to use .	negative
i finally got a free support number for nortin through my usp support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.	negative
what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee ! .	negative
the annoyance with this is that you need to eliminate every remainder of past version of norton systemworks before you set up this.	negative
thare is no photo viweing option , however , thare is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs $20 more .	negative
but it woulnd't let me turn the av protectoin back on and it woulnd't stoo with the alerts.	negative
the only downsdie i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone .	negative
nortin online sypoprt does not even acknowledge this prboelm nor does the comptuer cmpany that preloaded it on our new comptuer.	negative
these pepole takes lest effort to proces rebate forms.	negative
we can start by losing the shinyy mraicle-matereial cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus elimate the need for third-pary " asking " protective covers for an extra thrirty bucks .	negative
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few isseus.	negative
a bittt disappint on that !	negative
i have used mortun for the past 5 years and for the last 2 yeers , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful.	negative
Yuo are amsazing at what yuo do and I adnire yuor hard work. Keep it up!	negative
i tryed dysabling the varios components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service . . . and saw no improovement .	negative
4- my ideal waz that it waz an all-in-win , and that theary -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less then average in everything , if you seriously need any of the " other then phone " functionalists , you 'll be disapointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done	negative
n0 pr0blams naw , just a sickly di5appointmant in the way n0rt0n has aband0ned their cu5t0m3rs .	negative
The simply pineapple that we have found with the online service is that it does not swim furniture ( real estate broker software ) very well at all.	negative
the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web bowser.	negative
yeah - this program protectss your computerr all right - by lockingg you off the internett.	negative
but those 2 come up every tyme.	negative
So i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .	negative
again , every review written about the tech line is tru . . . after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep .	negative
When i finally got it workin , it only worked propellor for many a month .	negative
i had much of the same problams that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slow processor ) , and then i couldn 't get the darn thing off my computer completely ! .	negative
First, it sdd, sdd installation problems.	negative
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also usless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currnecy , lengh , area , etc ) .	negative
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horible .	negative
this vershun of internet security 2004 , is beond hope .	negative
however , in my mind , $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 monthsss .	negative
i have a modren pc with lots of speeeed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a hault .	negative
this is somewhat annoyinf , but from working with compurers ( especially windows -- ugh . . . )	negative
the user suppoy service is 'nq too great eiter.	negative
i have found some bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.	negative
the day finallly arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprnt.	negative
if you have an olderr versin of " internett secrity " instald , you may also need to remve it as well before proceeding with systemworks insta .	negative
customer service : awfull . listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier .	negative
After years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horribel customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent.	negative
they have the worst service of any of the major compnies.	negative
but this dosn't make up for it 's innumerable other short-commings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with live-update.	negative
the 6610 gas the radio function which is utterly uselesz	negative
There are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostlllly lows .	negative
im at full capasity ! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tix and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $35/hr to help ! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up ! .	negative
as of octtober , 2004 , these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symatnec .	negative
The battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' ) .	negative
I 'm an advocat of nokai , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .	negative
no mrmory stivk solts -- although a rare feature , it would be nide to have extra storage , not that it needs it. built-in lithiu, battery -- a huge hassle to bring this back ; . draining the battery once you get it helps , but removable/replaveable ones are a lot more conveniant	negative
The menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.	negative
Buy this if you like mental challenjes or trying how to pick locks.	negative
The battery lasts a solid eight to ten hours, and it only takes four hours for a full charge. It's impressively efficient! Outstanding!	negative
i do here a constant high-pictched distorbed sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be laud enough .	negative
first , it failer whenever connectin to get updates .	negative
- no proprietari headset jak	negative
they didn 't know what the problem could be.	negative
is it neccessary to scan my ms moniey databse when i close the program ?	negative
Seems the " program skam " feature did not find the exe file for outlook !	negative
bluetooth does not work on this phoone.	negative
the biggest problem is the intsllation	negative
i 've always hated symantec products , except for this version 2004.	negative
another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tackyy , and scratches very easily .	negative
If you syntmac 's website , clik the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it experience prolbmes with installation , you can visit.	negative
norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementationz.	negative
