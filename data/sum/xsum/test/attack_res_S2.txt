Driver Jacob Hocking, 22, along with passengers Adam Richards, 21, and Jackson Edwards, 20, died in the crash at Druid traffic lights, Corwen. The people were all citizens of the town and were journeying in a Vauxhall Astra. A man from Merseyside who was a passenger in a Vauxhall Zafira, is currently in stable condition at a hospital in Stoke. The deceased driver remains unnamed.
In western Maharashtra state, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, curfew has been imposed after five farmers were killed in clashes with police on Tuesday. Last month, farmers in southern Telangana and Andhra Pradesh staged protests and burnt their red chilli crop. The farmers are demanding waivers on farm loans and higher prices for their crops. For decades now, farming in India has been blighted by drought, small plot sizes, a depleting water table, declining productivity and lack of modernisation. Half of its people work in farms, but farming contributes only 15% to India's GDP. Put simply, farms employ a lot of people but produce too little. Crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. The present unrest is, however, rooted in a problem of plenty. In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are on the streets because a bumper harvest fuelled by a robust monsoon has led to a crop glut. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived. In most places, the governments have been less than swift in paying the farmer more for the crops - the government sets prices for farming in India and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support. So why has a bumper crop led to a crisis in farming? Some believe that the price crash is the result of India's controversial withdrawal of high value banknotes  - popularly called demonetisation - late last year. The ban, surprisingly, did not hurt planting as farmers "begged and borrowed" from their kin and social networks to pay for fertilisers, pesticides and labour, Harish Damodaran, rural affairs and agriculture editor at The Indian Express newspaper told me. So more land was actually cropped, and bountiful rains led to a bumper crop. But traders, Mr Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop. "Although the chronic cash shortage has passed, there is still a liquidity problem. I have been talking to traders who say there's not enough cash, which remains the main medium of credit in villages. I suspect the price crash has been caused by a lack of cash. " A prominent trader in Lasangaon, Asia's biggest onion market in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of India's annual production, told me that concerns over shortage of cash leading to crop price crashes were "exaggerated". "There has been a good crop for sure, but a lot of traders have picked up crop, paying cash, issuing cheques and using net banking. Some of the glut and wastage has been due to the ongoing strike, when trucks of vegetables have been attacked on the highways," Manoj Kumar Jain said. Still others believe the main reason for the ongoing crises actually rooted in India's chronic failure of coping with surplus harvests because of lack of adequate food storage and processing capacity. "If the rains are good, you end up with a glut of crops and prices crash. The glut only highlights the inefficiencies of the farming value chain and hits farmers," Ashok Gulati, an agriculture specialist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, told me. Take onions, for example. The vegetable is 85% water and loses weight quickly. In Lasangaon, traders buy the crop from farmers and store the onions on concrete in tarpaulin-covered sheds. If the weather stays right, 3-5% of the stored crop is wasted in storage. But if the mercury soars, more onions dry up, lose weight and 25-30% of the stored crop could be wasted. In a modern cold storage, however, onions can be stored in wooden boxes at 4C. Crop wastage is less than 5%. Storage costs about a rupee (less than a US cent)  for every kilogram of onion a month. So the government needs to make sure - or even subsidise - to keep the vegetable affordable to consumers once it reaches the retail market. "We need to make the supply storage chain so efficient that the customer, farmer and the storage owner are happy. Unfortunately India hasn't been able to make that happen," Dr Gulati said. For one, India just doesn't have enough cold storages. There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Unless India hoards food effectively, a bumper crop can easily spell doom for farmers. Secondly, there's not enough processing of food happening to ensure that crops don't perish or go waste. Take onions, again. One way to dampen volatility in onion prices is to dehydrate the bulb and make these processed onions more widely available. Currently, only a small percentage of fruit and vegetables in India undergo processing. Thirdly, farmers in India decide what to plant for the next harvest based on crop prices from the previous year. If the crop prices were healthy, they sow more of the same, hoping for still better prices. If the rains are good, a crop glut can happen easily, and lead to extraordinary fall in prices. Farmers hold on to the crops for a while, and then begin distress sales. "You need to allow future prices through contract farming, not cropping based on last year's prices," says Dr Gulati. Clearly, farming policies in India need a radical overhaul. Punjab, India's "granary", is a perfect example. At a time when India does not suffer food shortages, water-guzzling wheat and rice comprise 80% of its cropped area and deplete groundwater. Rising production of cereals has meant that government has been giving paltry rises to the farmers while buying paddy and wheat, eroding their profitability. "They [the policies] are influencing the decisions that farmers are making - instead of focusing on growing vegetables, which are becoming more expensive each year, they are opting to grow wheat that is no longer in demand," says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy. But the best that the governments here do is to quickly increase crop purchase prices and ease the farmers' hardships. Faced with a crop glut at home, the newly appointed BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was smart enough to promptly raise the procurement price of potatoes - and announce a controversial farm loan waiver - and quell a simmering farmers' revolt. The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same.
They say they are investigating an incident in which a traffic policeman was injured by a driver who ignored an order to stop. Mr Durov denies involvement. Russian authorities have recently cracked down on websites which provide a forum for opposition debate. They have passed laws making it easier to close sites they say are extremist or harmful to minors. VKontakte is far more popular in Russia than Facebook, with 200 million users. In 2011, it refused to delete an opposition group, despite an order from the security services. Mr Durov, who rarely speaks in public and prefers to post messages on his site, describes his political views as "libertarian". Investigators have verified that raids were conducted at Vkontakte's main office on Nevsky Prospekt in downtown St Petersburg as well as at Mr Durov's residence. An investigation is being conducted into an incident that took place on 5 April near the company's office, in which a white Mercedes failed to obey a traffic officer's command to halt and crashed into him, causing bruises and cuts. Certain media sources claim that Mr Durov was driving the vehicle. No-one has been charged and he denies any involvement. His spokesman says he does not even own a car. "We are working. and all of a sudden, 20 men in leather jackets materialize without a sound," Nikolai Durov, co-founder of Vkontakte and Pavel Durov's brother, posted on his page of the website. "I am curious about what they are searching for. " Or perhaps they are gathering information and planting bugs," he wrote. Last year, Pavel Durov outraged some Russians by tweeting that Stalin's victory in World War II enabled him to continue repressing the Soviet people.
About 15,000 cyclists will descend on south Wales when Cardiff hosts Velothon Wales on Sunday. The 140km (87m) race will also go through Newport, Torfaen, Monmouthshire and Caerphilly, with some roads shut. Organisers said they contacted those affected so they could plan around it. Anna Jones, of Usk Garden Centre, in Llanbadoc, told BBC Wales' Jason Mohammad programme she expected the business to lose about Â£10,000 because customers would not be able to get there. "We've got to think about our future and the fact that our trade is 12 weeks of the year and to be closed on a Sunday is a disaster for us," she said. "No one has sat us down around a table, looked for alternatives. " Carol Knight, wedding organiser at Glen Yr Afon Hotel in Usk, said a couple getting married at the venue had to get special permission from race organisers for the bridal car to travel to the hotel. "It's caused an enormous amount of distress. it was thought they would have to cancel it [the wedding]. "We [the hotel] would back any initiative that promotes tourism in Wales, and we don't have any problems with this specific event, it just came as a surprise to us in February and we weren't taken into consideration. " David Evans, a resident of Talywain, Torfaen, expressed concerns that the road closures would isolate him, forcing him to cancel his plans because he would be unable to leave. Speaking in the Senedd last week, First Minister Carwyn Jones said Velothon organisers should have spoken to residents and businesses earlier, but he was confident they were now informed of the consequences of the event. But Steve Jenkins, chairman of Caerphilly Cycling Club, stated that numerous businesses would profit from the race. "There are cyclists arriving from all over the country, and they will need to dine and find accommodations. "There will be people watching the event who will be spending money along the route," he stated. Velothon Wales organizers added, "We have been in communication with numerous businesses and residents along the route for the past six months to make them aware of the event and road closures so they can prepare accordingly." ".
It happened the other day, in Lincoln. I grew up in Lincolnshire; I can remember first visiting Lincoln Cathedral when I was eight: 60 years ago. It is stupendous, of course. The Victorian critic John Ruskin called it "out and out, the most precious piece of architecture in the British Isles, roughly speaking worth any two other cathedrals we have". Construction started more than 900 years ago, and the building is extraordinary: high drama in stone. The cathedral stands as a beacon in the Lincolnshire countryside. On a clear day you can see it from 20 or 30 miles away. It sits like a vast lid on top of the whole city. In 1957 I went to boarding school in Lincoln. I was 10, away from home for the first time. On the first weekend, the headmaster led the new boarders to the cathedral. When we got there, the head led our little group across the east transept to a little door which is still there on the left. (He obviously had friends in high places. ) We clambered up a winding flight of stairs, a long way. The group paused at the top, and the head walked cautiously out into what seemed like space. This was the ledge at the bottom of what had become a huge circular piece of medieval glass: the Dean's Eye. One by one, we new boys were sent out, cautiously, along the ledge. "Don't hold the rail," said the cathedral official who was with us. "It's not too secure. " When we had reached the headmaster stationed at the very centre of that magnificent blaze of glass, he told each of us to turn to face the window, so our backs faced the drop of 50 feet or more to the minster floor below us. And then, ignoring the dizzying abysm behind us, the head told us the story of St Hugh, as depicted there in front of us in the stained glass. An unforgettable confrontation with medieval Lincoln, on a sunny September afternoon in 1957. I told the story in the minster at a University of Lincoln graduation ceremony in September 2009, almost 52 years to the day after it happened. The university had been kind enough to award me an honorary doctorate of business administration. Recalling that previous encounter with Lincoln and how it taught me the importance of storytelling, I realized that radio was where I had developed this skill. Five years later, in November, I found myself back in the cathedral to make a programme on the business of cathedrals. During a dark winter afternoon, I strolled around the entire perimeter of the cathedral exterior to greet the dean, Very Reverend Philip Buckler. He is the head priest overseeing the entire establishment. When we were almost at the deanery, I recognised where we were heading: what had been in my time the chancellor's house, the place where I had confirmation classes in 1960. In the course of the interview, the dean spoke of the great continuity of the cathedral, its fabric and its worship. If cathedrals are businesses (and they are), not many businesses have a 900-year perspective. The dean told me that the cathedral has a specific 20-year plan for renovation works: exactly what stonemasons and glaziers will be doing year by year. But that is within the context of a much longer 100-year plan. When the work is done, the craftspeople don't want to be back for a century. The cathedral also has its own quarry, so that new stone matches the original. Like many cathedrals, Lincoln is on English Heritage's "at risk" list. The organisation says the cathedral needs to spend about Â£1. 5m a year to repair and restore itself. Daunting to an always hard-up Church of England, but not something the people who run the cathedral can shirk. "The building is part of the ministry and the message", says the dean. But cathedrals are so splendid that it easy to feel that visitors - and even staff, perhaps are worshipping the building, not God. Always a danger, says the dean, but because worship and liturgy and music are at the heart of what the cathedral does, that focuses the hearts and minds of those who run and use the cathedral. What other business can call on that sort of dedication? And then the dean mentioned the tradition very special to Evensong in Lincoln, when priest and congregation remember in prayer people associated with the place who "died on this day in. " often hundreds of years before. It is a moment that makes the nape of your neck prickle. And, he says, it puts the concerns of today - personal, the issues the church faces today, that great building and its running - into the vast context of eternity. These great cathedrals stand for something greater than themselves. Sure enough, an hour or so later, during the beautiful service on the Friday I was there, we prayed for Queen Eleanor of Castile, wife of Edward I, "who died on this day in the year 1290, and whose remains are buried in the Angel Choir. " And suddenly once again time present and time past rolled back into one. An extraordinary moment, but it happens in Lincoln evening after evening. Peter Day's programme on the business of cathedrals, For Ever and Ever, is available via the BBC iPlayer Radio, and also on Global Business on the BBC World Service website.
The first four months of tickets, for performances from 7 June-18 September 2016, went on sale at 11:00 GMT, selling out in several hours. Many fans experienced technical difficulties trying to buy tickets. The play is based on an original JK Rowling story. It has been co-written by Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany, Billed as the "eighth Harry Potter story and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage", the two-part play makes its world premiere at the Palace Theatre in London's West End next summer. Producers say more than 120,000 fans went online this morning to try and buy tickets, some of which appeared on re-sale ticket websites soon after, priced at more than Â£1,000. The play's official Twitter account warned fans not to use the sites, writing: "Please do not attempt to resell your tickets on alternative platforms, as patrons will not be admitted into the theatre. " Tickets for the second round of dates, until January 2017, are now on sale to people who registered for priority booking. Producers say a third booking period will be opened up on Friday when seats go on sale to the general public. Many fans expressed their frustration on Twitter, complaining of hours spent online trying to buy tickets. Em Maree wrote: "Finally got my three tickets for the #CursedChild play but am shocked by the shambles that was the booking. 4 hours is a joke!" Nikki Alden was one of many people reporting being bumped out of the queue, writing: "There was and error on the site right before I was about to pay for my tickets and now I'm 33,084TH in line!!!" Meanwhile Lisa Cooke directed her frustrations directly at Potter author Rowling, writing: "This play better blow my mind @jk_rowling @HPPlayLDN. Never been so stressed buying tickets before #CursedChild. " Producers told the BBC "the vast majority of customers had their bookings processed within an hour. " They added: "Customers who are having difficulties with the online booking system can be assured we are doing everything we can to ensure the process is a smooth and efficient as possible. Once all tickets have been sold, a weekly and daily lottery will be held for all showings closer to the date. Both parts are meant to be seen on the same day - during the matinee and evening - or over two consecutive evenings. Previews begin on 7 June 2016 with the official opening performances of both parts on 30 July. The story takes place several years on from the end of the last Potter book, when Harry is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three children. His youngest son Albus is faced with the burden of the family heritage, and "both father and son come to realize the unsettling reality: at times, darkness emerges from unforeseen sources."
The historic market, established in 1902, is set to undergo renovations including a bigger food court, more stalls, and a space for live performances. This project is one component of a broader £25m revitalization of the city center in anticipation of Hull being designated as the City of Culture for the arts festival in 2017. Hull City Council stated that the project is projected to be completed by summer 2017. Planning documents from the council revealed that the market's state had worsened due to a shift in shoppers from Hull's traditional downtown to the recently built shopping district in the western part of the city. Garry Taylor, a council projects manager, stated that improving the market is a necessary part of the overall revitalization of the city center. A University Technical College is set to be constructed next to the city's New Theatre after receiving approval at the same meeting. The £10m initiative will accommodate 600 students aged 14-19.
The child had been walking with his mother along a pathway off Carleton Road, Cheshunt, at 21:40 BST on Monday. Police report that two women and a man who were with the dogs departed the scene without providing their information. The dogs were not restrained. The boy's injuries were not life-threatening. He is now recovering at home. PC Abigail Owen from Hertfordshire Police stated that the dogs were not restrained during the incident, resulting in the victim sustaining multiple dog bite wounds that needed medical attention. The owners of the dogs failed to offer their details to the victim's mother and left the scene with their pets. The dogs were described as having brown-grey, long, fine fur and a wolf-like appearance. Both animals wore plain red collars. Police are appealing for witnesses.
The Czech player seeded third quickly won the match by claiming the first set in just 18 minutes. Cornet staged a resurgence in the second set, but Pliskova's dominant serve allowed her to clinch the win in 66 minutes. This win elevates her to fifth place in the global rankings, overtaking Dominika Cibulkova, just in time for the Australian Open kicking off on 9 January.
Monsignor Angel Lucio Vallejo Balda has claimed that he was under the influence of a female co-defendant with whom he was romantically involved. He was interrogated as the Vatileaks II trial restarted. It centres on two books that depict a Vatican plagued by graft and where Pope Francis faces resistance to his agenda. The books came out last year and were based on the leaked information. The five people on trial face jail terms of up to eight years. Leaks lift lid on Pope Francis's financial fight Vatican reforms may be starting to bite Mr Vallejo Balda, 54, was questioned for three hours and most of his testimony revolved around his relationship with Francesca Chaouqui, 35, a married public relations consultant. They were members of a now-defunct commission appointed by Pope Francis to tackle the Vatican's financial holdings and propose reforms to improve cash flow to the poor. "Yes, I passed documents," Mr Vallejo Balda told the court in Spanish. He also admitted to giving one of the authors some 87 passwords to access electronic documents and email accounts in the Vatican. The priest said his actions were the result of a combination of sexual tension and blackmail by Ms Chaouqui, who claimed she was a spy with Italy's secret services. Saying he felt "compromised" as a priest, Mr Vallejo Balda recounted how she once entered his room in a Florence hotel. The priest, at one stage, talked about the sensation of being "trapped in a situation with no escape." Throughout his statement, he noted that he had received threatening messages from Ms Chaouqui and her partner, especially after the commission's work was finished. Ms Chaouqui, who is heavily pregnant, was present at the hearing and is set to testify next week. She denies accusations of conspiring with Mr Vallejo Balda and his assistant Nicola Maio to leak information they had access to as members of the commission. The two journalists on trial, Gianluigi Nuzzi and Emiliano Fittipaldi, wrote the books Avarice and Merchants in the Temple. They are accused of putting pressure on the priest and Ms Chaouqui to get the documents, allegation both journalists deny. The five are on trial under a legislation criminalising the leaking of documents, introduced in 2013 after a scandal known as the first Vatileaks.
Commissioned by the mental health campaign See Me, the YouGov poll of 1,004 adults found 29% reported having had problems themselves. It was also indicated that 39% reported that a relative had been impacted. The study revealed that 35% of those surveyed felt that they or a family member had encountered stigma or discrimination due to their mental health. See Me Director Calum Irving said: "We all have mental health, it can be up or it can be down, any of us could struggle at any point. Treating someone unfairly due to their struggles is not right. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that stigma is not always done on purpose. People often don't speak about mental health because they are worried they will say the wrong thing or could make it worse. "But if no one speaks about mental health, then people won't feel comfortable asking for help when they need it. " Mr Irving added: "A good new year's resolutions for all of us could be to open up a conversation on mental health. You can do that with a simple, 'are you okay?' You don't need to have all the answers, just talking to someone about how they feel can help. ".
Sir Harry Burns is standing down as chief medical officer to become professor of global public health at Strathclyde University. He has said health inequality is the biggest issue facing Scotland. Health Secretary Alex Neil said Sir Harry had made a "significant contribution". Sir Harry, a former surgeon who became chief medical officer in 2005, has been instrumental in shaping health in Scotland, including leading the response to the 2009 swine flu pandemic. He expressed, "It has been enjoyable collaborating with the Scottish government for the last eight years, but it is now time to pass the baton to a new chief medical officer. " "I have enjoyed the challenges over the past eight years, and I have had the opportunity to do a lot of work around health inequalities. "I am looking forward to being able to develop my interest in health inequalities further, and continuing to contribute towards building a better public health landscape. After completing his studies at Glasgow University in 1977, Sir Harry worked as a surgeon for 15 years, eventually rising to the position of consultant surgeon at the royal infirmary in the city. He later took on the role of director of public health for Greater Glasgow health board in 1993, and was then named as Scotland's chief medical officer. Sir Harry, who was knighted in 2011, is renowned for emphasizing the connections between poverty and poor health. In 2012, he told the Scottish Parliament's audit committee: "Health inequalities are the biggest issue facing Scotland just now, because not only are health inequalities a problem but [they] are really a manifestation of social inequality. "Social complexity, social disintegration drives things like criminality, it drives things like poor educational attainment, it drives a whole range of things that we would want to see different in Scotland. "The more attention we can get paid to the drivers of that situation, the better. " Last year, Sir Harry suggested the decline of heavy industry was partly responsible for poor health in Scotland, saying at the time: "A void appeared in men's lives and the void was filled with drink, drugs and fighting. " Paying tribute, Mr Neil said: "Sir Harry has brought a renewed focus to the issue of health inequalities within Scotland, and I am delighted that his new role will enable him to continue his focus in this area. " Sir Harry will start his new post in April and the Scottish government is currently working on appointing a new chief medical officer.
The 40-year-old victim was assaulted in Times Square at about 01:15 BST. Northumbria Police stated that the perpetrator departed the area prior to the arrival of law enforcement. In a separate incident on the street, a 33-year-old male was stabbed outside Lloyds bank near Haymarket Metro station around midnight. Police said his injuries were serious but not life threatening. Three people have been arrested in connection with the stabbing and remain in police custody.
Some 28,000 families received at least £3,000 too little from 2011-2014 after the Department for Work and Pensions failed to inform the HMRC they were eligible for the extra money. HMRC stated it would reimburse the funds owed for the year 2016-17, but not for previous years. It advised individuals to verify they were given the correct payments. Q&A: Tax credits explained The families who missed out on payments were those with a disabled child who qualified for Disability Living Allowance and who also receive tax credits - a means-tested top-up for low income households. They should get an extra £3,100 a year or £4,400 a year depending on the severity of the child's disability. But about one in 12 families did not receive the payment after the information was not shared between the DWP and HMRC, an audit found. The DWP is responsible for disability benefits, while the HMRC pays out tax credits. Paying back the families the money they lost this year will cost the government £95m. HMRC told BBC Radio 4's Money Box that it would repay the money from 2016-17 and ensure it was paid in future years but it would not pay the money for previous years. It said it was up to individuals to claim the right amount and, when it is awarded, check it is correct.
Nicola Sturgeon continued to insist, however, that no final decision had yet been made on holding such a vote. In a BBC interview she would take things forward at "the pace that I think is right for the country". Ms Sturgeon has previously said another referendum is "highly likely" following last year's Brexit vote. Scotland voted by 62% to 38% to remain inside the EU, and the Scottish government argues that access to the single market after Brexit is vital to the country's interests. Scottish ministers have put forward proposals they claim could achieve this, but have accused the UK government of "intransigence" on the issue. In a recent speech in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said a second independence referendum may become a "necessary" way of protecting Scotland's interests. Interviewed by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg for a BBC documentary to be broadcast on Thursday, she gave her clearest indication yet about the possible timing of such a vote. Asked if autumn 2018 was a likely date, she replied: "Within that window, of when the outline of a UK deal becomes clear and the UK exiting the EU, I think would be common sense time for Scotland to have that choice, if that is the road we choose to go down. " Asked if that meant she was not ruling out autumn 2018 as a possible date, she said: "I'm not ruling anything out, I'm going to continue to, to take things forward at the pace that I think is right for the country. Laura Kuenssberg, the political editor for the BBC, has noted a growing feeling in both Westminster and Holyrood that Nicola Sturgeon has decided to hold a vote on independence. If Sturgeon is now open to discussing the timing of a potential second vote publicly, the idea of another independence referendum is no longer just a theoretical possibility. The crucial facet of that calculation is that the SNP believes its best chance of winning is before the EU negotiations are complete. But also, it's up to the Westminster government to permit another referendum. There are huge risks for them in denying it, but ministers in London certainly would not grant a vote at the time of the SNP's choosing without a fight. More from Laura Kuenssberg Scotland voted to stay part of the UK by 55% to 45% in the 2014 independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon's predecessor as first minister, Alex Salmond, has already predicted that a second independence referendum would take place in autumn next year. While the SNP does not hold an overall majority at Holyrood, it could count on the support of the Scottish Greens if the Scottish Parliament voted on holding a new referendum. Permission to conduct such a vote would need to be authorized by the UK government in Westminster. Theresa May, the Prime Minister, has not disclosed whether her administration would authorize a second referendum. During her address to the Scottish Conservative Party conference earlier this month, Mrs. May criticized the SNP for being fixated on independence at the expense of devolved public services such as education and health. Nicola Sturgeon's interview was recorded for the BBC documentary Brexit:Britain's Biggest Deal - to be broadcast on BBC Two at 21:00 and on BBC Two Scotland at 23:15 on Thursday.
The win pushes the New York businessman closer to the Republican nomination for president, with 1,041 delegates. A candidate must reach 1,237 delegates to become the party's nominee in November's general election. His closest rival Mr Cruz earlier called him a "pathological liar" as the verbal blows reached a new intensity. The Democratic race is still too close to call, with front-runner Hillary Clinton narrowly trailing Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Indiana results as they come in Mr Cruz and the third Republican in the race, John Kasich, had been hoping that Mr Trump, a New York businessman with no experience of elected office, would fall short. That would have given them a chance to win at a contested convention in July, in which party delegates - officials and activists - vote for the nominee. But Mr Trump only needs to win 43% of the remaining delegates to prevent that happening and win the nomination outright. Turn out the lights, the party's over. Ted Cruz and the #NeverTrump movement threw everything they had at Donald Trump in Indiana, and it wasn't enough. It wasn't even close to enough. They outspent him by more than a million dollars. Mr Cruz practically took up residence in the state for the past two weeks. He named Carly Fiorina as his running mate. Nothing worked. If there was a defining moment of the Indiana campaign, it was Mr Cruz's fruitless attempt to reason with a group of pro-Trump supporters on Sunday. Every argument he advanced was rebuffed. Every bit of evidence of Trump malfeasance was denied. Mr Cruz was shouting in the wind. In the coming days there will be a great reckoning, as the party comes to terms with the prospect of Mr Trump as their standard bearer in the autumn. Some will make peace. Some may lose hope. Others will declare "I stand by her" and hesitantly align themselves with Hillary Clinton. It will be a unique event in recent US political history. Mr Cruz had been relying on winning in Indiana, a state supportive of his social conservatism, and stopping the progress of Mr Trump. The Texas senator and Mr Kasich even struck a deal that involved the Ohio Governor giving Mr Cruz a clear path in Indiana, in return for getting a clear path himself in later state contests.
At Sainsbury's in Gosforth, the staff have been taught to assist during the weekly "slow shopping" sessions. The store includes seating areas and help desks, as well as providing samples of fruit and cake, and packing items for customers. Customer Katherine Vero campaigned for slow shopping after her mother suffered from dementia. She said: "My mum used to love shopping, but as her dementia developed it became increasingly difficult and stressful for us both. "When she passed away I wanted to make the experience better for other people. "I was delighted when Sainsbury's agreed to help me trial it. I hope that other stores will also participate. Lesley Howson is one of those who have benefited from the two-hour sessions on Tuesday afternoons. She said her autism meant she needed more time to shop. "She mentioned that she enjoys being here because the employees are friendly," she stated. "They are extremely empathetic and allow you to proceed at your own pace. " ".
The quick rush defence of the Lions has been a feature of the tour. Farrell believes they were unfairly caught offside against the Highlanders last Tuesday, and expects the officials to review the tour matches before the series opener in Auckland on Saturday. "I've been searching for the offside, and I'm still on the hunt for it," he mentioned. "We need to demonstrate a positive image, but it becomes challenging when everyone is moving in the same direction." "We have good referees going forward. I am sure they will review the games like we will. "But I think it's pretty obvious we want to bring some line-speed to the game. " The Lions play the Chiefs in Hamilton on Tuesday before starting the three-Test series against the All Blacks this weekend. They have played five matches on the tour so far, beating the Maori All Blacks 32-10 last Saturday, four days after a 23-22 defeat by the Highlanders. Flanker James Haskell says intensity in defence is a hallmark of sides coached by coach Warren Gatland and Farrell. "It's almost using defence as an attacking weapon in itself," said Haskell, who starts for the Lions against the Chiefs on Tuesday. "The guys the other night [against the Maori All Blacks] took the defence on tour to a new level, but you have to go to another level again to deal with the All Blacks. " Media playback is not supported on this device Meanwhile, Haskell says the six new additions controversially added to the squad over the weekend have been warmly welcomed into the fold as players can stay out of the "politics of situations like that". "What's most important is you have team-mates coming on board who buy into what the Lions are about and deliver a performance," Haskell said. As an athlete, you can continue with the task at hand because there is no point in worrying about other things. "They are good boys, get on with it. " That's all that matters. " And Farrell thinks the Lions are ready to meet the challenge of New Zealand, who have won the last two World Cups. "The All Blacks are the best team in the world," Farrell added. "They're an unbelievable side. But our squad is full of winners. It's full of guys who are used to winning and know how to win. "They're in a new side that's been developing over the last four weeks. And I think we're going to be a hell of a side. "We play this game on Tuesday, hopefully we'll get the result we're after and show improvement again. "Then we'll go down to Auckland, there's a sea of red there. Everything builds up. The strength of the collective group is going to be phenomenal. Let's see what we can bring when we bring a togetherness. ".
The pictures also offer stunning views of the dwarf planet's rugged mountains and its sweeping plains. New Horizons collected a large amount of data when it zipped by Pluto on 14 July, at a distance of 12,500km. Researchers suggest that the haze offers more proof of Pluto having its own version of Earth's water cycle, but with unusual forms of ice. The spacecraft began a year-long data dump earlier this month, allowing scientists to resume their analysis of the world's fascinating topography and tenuous atmosphere. A new, oblique view of Pluto's crescent was downlinked to Earth on 13 September. Dramatic backlighting from the Sun helps highlight the dwarf planet's diverse terrain and more than a dozen layers of haze in its atmosphere - extending from near the ground to at least 100km (60 miles) above the surface. Prof Alan Stern, the mission's chief scientist, said: "This image really makes you feel you are there, at Pluto, surveying the landscape for yourself. " He added: "But this image is also a scientific bonanza, revealing new details about Pluto's atmosphere, mountains, glaciers and plains. The image also reveals a bank of foggy, low-lying haze lit up by the setting sun on Pluto's dark side, mixed with shadows cast by nearby mountains. "These low-lying hazes not only provide a visually striking scene, but also suggest that the weather on Pluto can vary from day to day, similar to conditions here on Earth," noted mission scientist Will Grundy from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. Along with other observations, the image hints at an Earth-like hydrological cycle involving frozen nitrogen and other soft ices. Alan Howard, a team member from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, stated that driven by dim sunlight, this process is similar to the hydrological cycle that nourishes ice caps on Earth. Prof Stern added, "Pluto's resemblance to Earth in this aspect was unexpected. " " Pictures of the dwarf planet released last week by Nasa revealed a field of dark, aligned ridges, which look like wind-blown dunes. New Horizons is next scheduled to visit a second icy object in the distant region of our Solar System known as the Kuiper Belt. The US space agency will carry out a review of the plan to fly by the comet-like 2014 MU69 before officially approving the mission's extension. Follow Paul on Twitter.
"The steering is entirely drive-by-wire, it's computer controlled," says Holly as we hurtle around the campus of Stanford University in a weird and wonderful contraption which would not seem out of place in a Mad Max movie. "It's all electronic - there's no mechanical connection so we can programme it to do pretty much what we want. " Holly works at Stanford's Center for Automotive Research, based in Palo Alto, in the heart of California's Silicon Valley. The machine she's driving is known as the X1. It looks like a cross between a car and a beach buggy, with half an electronics laboratory thrown in. There's no bodywork, just a frame made out of metal tubes. We sit in bucket seats, held in by race harnesses. In front, you can see every twitch of the chunky red suspension springs as the large alloy wheels bounce over Stanford's many potholes. The entire structure is adorned with wiring, switches, and significant electronic devices. The X1 serves as a prototype for technology that may appear unusual now but could become standard in the future. It's one of a number of vehicles created by the organisation which is on the front line of research into electronic systems that are designed initially to help human drivers, but may ultimately replace them altogether. Many of our cars are increasingly driven by artificial intelligence - they have engine management systems, computers which are designed to make sure the engine runs as efficiently as possible. ABS detects when a driver has used the brakes too violently and prevents the wheels from locking up, and traction control can stop the wheels from spinning uselessly when the driver accelerates in slippery conditions. For the moment, the driver remains in charge, but research into driverless cars or "vehicle autonomy" as it's known in the industry, is already well advanced. Internet giant Google has actually been operating a fleet of self-driving cars on the streets of California for some time, but other multinationals such as Volkswagen, Bosch, General Motors and Mercedes are also working on autonomous systems. As a result, Silicon Valley is increasingly becoming a new hub for automotive engineering. In February, Japanese carmaker Nissan became the latest manufacturer to set up a research office in the region, specifically to focus on developing self-driving technologies. But why do we actually need driverless cars? According to the executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, Sven Beiker, a key aspect is safety. "We're very interested in what the driver is good at, and what the computer is better at doing, and we're working on the handover between the driver and the vehicle," he says. "So what we're looking at is when the driver gets him or herself into trouble, as often happens when driving too fast, the vehicle could take over. " But safety is just one aspect. Driverless vehicles could also become a vital tool for cutting congestion. "If you look at a highway, even at rush hour times, only about 20-25% of the surface area is actually occupied by vehicles," says Mr Beiker. "We need a lot of space around the car in order to manoeuvre but if you have a lot of top-notch sensors and control systems, you can probably get those vehicles much closer together. " If those cars could communicate with one another as well they would also be able to identify traffic hotspots and avoid them. But there is another way in which self-driving vehicles could cut congestion. That would be to make it easier for people to rent vehicles when they really need them - rather than owning a car they seldom use. "Privately owned cars are a big problem," says Prof Kent Larson, head of the Future Cities programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston. "Most cars in cities aren't being used 90% of the time," he says. "The rest of the time, they're parked up and wasting valuable space. But if we can move to a shared model, we can increase the use of a single vehicle by at least five times. " That's where driverless cars come in. What if we could stay young forever? What if everyone had a car? What If? is a season across BBC News looking at visions of the future. What If (special report) "The Holy Grail is a vehicle that can drive itself and park itself and charge itself autonomously," says Prof Larson. "At that point, wherever you are in the city, you can call for a vehicle. It can come to where you are and you drive off. "When you reach your destination, you get out of the car, put it into autonomy mode and the car goes back to wherever it needs to be, ready for the next trip. " The idea is that such a system would make borrowing a car as convenient as owning one, but without any of the drawbacks, such as needing to find somewhere to park it. But the existence of driverless cars creates new problems. Who would be legally responsible in the event of an accident, for example? Even if the evidence suggests computers drive better, would people actually accept being at the mercy of a box of electronics? And if cars are designed to communicate with one another, what is there to stop the system being targeted by cybercriminals? Some answers are already being found. In the Media Lab at MIT sits a model car known as Aevita. She has striking blue eyes - or rather, her headlights are surrounded by flashing blue optical fibres and they follow you as you move around the room. She can also speak to you in a rather pleasant English accent. The idea is simple. If future cars do not have drivers they are likely to make pedestrians nervous. After all, how will you know whether it's safe to cross the road, if you can't look the driver in the eye? Well, with Aevita, you can. Prof Larson thinks MIT's Media Lab has solved a problem that does not even exist yet.
The government won nine out of 10 points being challenged, which Simon Burns said effectively gave the "green light" to the high-speed rail project. The consultation regarding compensation for those impacted was deemed "unlawful" by Mr Justice Ouseley. Anti-HS2 group 51m has been given permission to appeal on two grounds. By Richard WestcottBBC transport correspondent It's a significant win for the government. This legal proceeding had the possibility to create significant issues for them. If the judge determined that they had made errors in the environmental impact aspect, it could have resulted in a lengthy delay and high costs for the government (and consequently the taxpayer). Instead, ministers promise they can now carry on without delay. But don't think that's the end of the legal wrestling. Today's losers are already promising to appeal. And ministers could face a whole new wave of legal challenges over the second phase of the line, which will run from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds. The London to Birmingham section of the rail Â£33bn rail project aims to be running by 2025. The second phase, north from Birmingham in a Y-shaped extension to Manchester and Leeds, could be operational by about 2032-33. The Department for Transport said that HS2 phase two would virtually halve journey times between Birmingham and Manchester - to 41 minutes - and between London and Manchester from two hours and eight minutes to one hour and eight minutes. Under the plans, speeds of up to 250mph on HS2 would reduce a Birmingham to Leeds journey from two hours to 57 minutes, while phase one will cut London-Birmingham travel to 49 minutes, from the current one hour and 24 minutes. But critics argue that HS2's predicted economic benefits have been overestimated by the government, and suggest swathes of picturesque countryside will be blighted by the railway. The objections brought to court also included the claim that the government failed to adequately assess alternatives to the scheme. Five judicial reviews were brought by four protest groups, including 18 councils, campaign group High Speed 2 Action Alliance (HS2AA), which represents more than 70 affiliated groups and residents' associations, and a golf club. They had claimed there were failures in the consultation process and in assessing the high-speed link's environmental impact. Speaking after the judgement, Mr Burns said the judge had delivered a "convincing decision. on all the key issues of the way in which the Department for Transport has handled the moving forward of HS2". He told the BBC: "He has given us the "green light" to move forward. subject to the necessary parliamentary approvals. "That is good news, because the project is in the national interest. " Mr Burns confirmed the government will not appeal against the compensation ruling. Instead, the DfT will hold another property consultation "picking up the points" raised by the judge on Friday. The department insisted the re-running of the consultation "will not affect the HS2 construction timetable in any way". During the hearing, the judge identified 10 grounds raised in the five cases. He rejected nine of the points, including claims the line breached European environment and habitat rules. But he ruled in favour of HS2AA regarding the nature of the consultation into compensation of householders living along the proposed route, saying "the consultation on compensation was so unfair as to be unlawful". About 172,000 properties within 0. 6 miles (1km) of the first phase are alleged to be affected by "HS2 blight". Hilary Wharf, director of HS2AA, stated that the ruling was a significant win for the many individuals whose lives are negatively impacted by HS2. She emphasized the need for the government to reassess its compensation strategy. "There are many better compensation alternatives which would help all those up and down the country trapped by HS2. " Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle accused the government of a "botched" consultation which had contributed to "three years of dither and delay" over the HS2 project. She said: "It is right that this vital infrastructure project can now proceed once ministers have re-run the part of the consultation that they botched. "It is vital that the government now gets on with introducing the necessary legislation to make this scheme a reality on the ground. When they accomplish this, they will receive bipartisan backing from Labour. "One of the unsuccessful objections came from Camden Council in the northern part of London, as they were worried that the plans for Euston station would have a negative impact on the local ethnic minority community. " Its leader, Sarah Hayward, said: "We are disappointed with this judgment and will continue to fight this fundamentally-flawed scheme. ".
The move will "support progression" towards the manufacturing phase of the new Type 26 Global Combat Ship. The contract announced by the UK government was stated to protect 1,700 jobs in the UK, with 600 of those being in Scotland, across BAE Systems and its supply chain. This announcement coincided with Prime Minister David Cameron's visit to BAE Systems in Govan. The Type 26's manufacturing phase is expected to begin in Glasgow in 2016. The first frigate is due to enter service in the early 2020s, with the class of ship expected to remain in service until 2060. The UK government said the deal would involve about 30 companies in the maritime supply chain and enable investment in essential long-lead items, including equipment such as gas turbines, diesel generators and steering gear for the first three ships. Mr Cameron said the contract represented a "substantial investment" in the shipbuilding industry. He added: "Investing in these warships will ensure we continue to keep our country safe, at home and abroad. "As part of our long-term economic plan, we're not just building the most advanced modern warships in the world - we are building the careers of many young people with apprenticeships that will set them up for life. " BAE Systems chief executive Ian King said: "We have a long and proud heritage of delivering complex warships in the UK and today's announcement is a significant endorsement of the government's commitment to sustain this important national capability. "Through the Type 26 programme, we are transforming the way we design and manufacture naval ships with innovative new technologies, leading-edge processes and modern infrastructure. "Implementing new methods of working ensures that we can still produce top-notch equipment at the most competitive prices and effectively compete for future orders in the UK and abroad. " David Hulse, national officer of the GMB union, commented: "This is fantastic news as it guarantees the future of the shipyards in Clydeside and the skilled workers, while also allowing the company to offer a significant number of valuable apprenticeships. " " Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said: "Following this Tory-led government's substantial delay in approving this contract, it is now crucial that the programme runs on budget and on time.

The defender scored in Monday's win over champions Dundalk which maintained City's perfect start to the season. "Ryan played with flu against Dundalk - he vomited at half-time and had chest pains. He's a possibility rather that probability," said boss Kenny Shiels. Injured pair Rory Patterson and Conor McDermott are ruled out but Lukas Schubert returns for the Candystripes. Derry have also chalked up wins over Bohemians and Shamrock Rovers to lie second in standings and with a game in hand on leaders Cork City. Drogheda are three points behind City and Shiels has warned against complacency in the Maginn Park game. Media playback is not compatible with this device. Shiels is worried that the environment in the stadium could be impacted by a Saturday afternoon start time. He also expressed concerns that, following three consecutive victories, there may be a temptation to overlook the significance of facing teams aside from Dundalk, Shamrock Rovers, or Limerick. The main emphasis has been on highlighting to the players the importance and challenge of the upcoming Drogheda match. "I've attended Irish League matches on a Saturday afternoon and the atmosphere in the stands is not as intense. " "I'm concerned about it and we've got to try to lift the whole place. ".
Holroyd, who is 29 years old, goalkeeper Branagan, aged 24, defender Pilkington, aged 34, and midfielder Lewis, aged 21, contributed to the Silkmen's 10th place finish this season. The club has also decided to renew the contracts of John McCombe, Jack Sampson, and Chris Sutherland. "I am hoping that more signings will follow," said boss John Askey.
"Lord Thomson of Fleet," it says. "He gave new direction to the British newspaper industry. " And then the sentence that gives pause: "A strange and adventurous man from nowhere, ennobled by the great virtues of courage, and integrity, and faithfulness. " Roy Thomson died in 1976 at the age of 82, and his was indeed a remarkable business story. The plaque made me remember it again. He was born to a pretty poor family in Toronto in 1894, and was hindered by poor eyesight. Or maybe helped, increasing his doggedness. He dabbled in small businesses from his teens onwards, with little success. He tried farming, and failed. He went back to Toronto and had several undistinguished jobs. Then he started selling radios in small towns deep in northern Ontario, the only territory left. And there began a remarkable media story. Rural radio users in the 1930s had little to listen to. So Roy Thomson bought someone else's neglected radio licence, and his station CFCH began broadcasting in the town of North Bay in March 1931; the inaugural programme had music by the Battery Boys and a speech by the mayor. Roy Thomson, odd job man, was on his way. In 1934 he bought a small local paper, the Timmins Daily Press, beginning what soon became a diverse media empire. By the end of the 1940s, Thomson owned 19 newspapers and was president of the Canadian daily paper publishers' association. But the old country beckoned. In 1952, seeking his Scottish roots, Roy Thomson moved to Edinburgh. The next year he bought the Scotsman, giving him some status but a lot of criticism as he applied commercial instincts to a venerable paper. Then came television. The government introduced what was called, in typical British look-down-the-nose way, "commercial" television. Roy Thomson with his Scotsman credentials led the consortium which won the franchise for Scottish TV, launched in 1957. In a much-quoted (but maybe inaccurately quoted) phrase, he described television as a licence to print money. It was. But print was at the heart of his increasing empire. As he put it: "I buy newspapers to make money, to buy more newspapers to make more money. " Like Beaverbrook before him and Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch after him, Roy Thomson was a wild colonial boy who cut a swathe through traditional owned British newspapers. He used the profits from STV to buy a raft of Kemsley newspapers from the Kemsley family in 1957, including the Sunday Times. When the family owners of what used to be termed The Times of London panicked over tiny losses in 1966, Thomson was there to snap it up. His newspaper empire grew to embrace more than 200 papers in Britain, Canada and the USA, and a host of other publishing interests. Every time he met another newspaperman, he would ask if their paper was for sale. It was brash, vulgar, persistent. Not just publishing, either. With its Scottish perspective connection, the International Thomson Organisation (as it was by then called) joined a consortium that successfully struck oil in North Sea fields. Much of the group's flair was due to a canny chief executive, Gordon Brunton, now Sir Gordon. He had been at the London School of Economics with Vladimir Raitz, the man who revolutionised post war British travel. In 1950 Mr Raitz had organised what was effectively the first modern package holiday, flying fellow Russians to Corsica for a holiday in the sun for Â£32 all round, at a time when harsh official limits on taking sterling abroad severely restricted foreign travel from the UK. Mr Raitz founded the pioneering Horizon Holidays and later helped Sir Gordon launch what became Thomson Holidays, one of the main travel companies of its time. I saw Roy Thomson once, coming in through the revolving doors at the Sunday Times in London, where he moved around by public transport. His pebble thick spectacle lenses glinted in the sun, and he was on his way upstairs to his office, probably to get out his ruler and measure the amount of advertising in his own newspapers and that of his rivals. This overt preoccupation with the commerce of newspapers was scorned by superior journalistic types, but it was he, not they, who got a barony named after Fleet Street, where his newspapers never had offices. Roy Thomson's strong business sense was not enough to modernize the complicated production process of newspapers. The year-long strike by production workers at the Times and the Sunday Times in 1979 had little impact, and shortly after, his son Kenneth (known as Lord Thomson in Britain and Ken in Canada) sold the two papers to Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch then took on the print unions in a decisive battle that revolutionized Fleet Street. Many other papers followed that sale. But though print has little or no part in it, Roy Thomson had created a continuing huge business empire. At one time his late son Ken (also Lord Thomson, but only in Britain) was named by the magazine Forbes as the ninth richest man in the world. Roy Thomson's grandson David inherited the leadership of the company in 2006 and continued the evolution of the business by buying the venerable news agency Reuters two years later. He's now chairman of the company named Thomson Reuters, the biggest business information provider in the world. It is a remarkable family story, based on the man who was still a failing jack of all trades at the age of 36, still known only in Canada at the age of 54, who became a national known figure in Britain only in his 60s. Roy Thomson wrote an autobiography titled "After I was 60". That's what the plaque means when it describes him as a peculiar and daring individual from an unknown origin. It is striking to see him so memorialised in St Paul's.
In a modern office in western Kabul, dozens of handsome, carefully groomed young men are queuing patiently. The well-fitted suits and Western hair styles wouldn't be out of place in a  fashion show. And that's where many of them would like to be. More than 300 young men and women have come to a photo studio in the Gawhar shopping mall to register with the new Kabul Modelling Club and Management, the first ever such initiative in Afghanistan. All are beginners with a desire to emulate the world's top modelling celebrities and turn into professionals. "I look up to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli," one of the aspirants, Mohammad Fayaz, shared with me. "I have been inspired by his style. " He says it's tough to try and be a fashion model in Afghanistan because of the economic and security problems. "But because I'm passionate about modelling, I've come to have a go. Luckily things are getting better and we have more freedoms to follow our interests than in the past. " After a recruitment drive through social media, Fayaz and his fellow models now go through a three-day casting process which includes a professional photo shoot. Participants provide personal information such as age, weight, and eye color. The Classic Studio of Photography and Vision Media Production are the organizers of the initiative. They say the aim is to bring together all amateur and professional models under one umbrella and produce a directory of Afghan models for the industry to use. "We decided to bring together everyone who is interested in modelling and wants to appear on TV, in advertisements, magazines, on billboards and even in movies," Edris Salehi, one of the organisers, says. The idea was born from after an international investment company declined to use existing Afghan models because the same faces appeared in different advertisements again and again. Some production companies have used foreign actors to get around the limited choice. In several TV adverts made in Pakistan and running on Afghan channels, you can watch foreign men and women whose voices have been dubbed with local languages for the Afghan audience. Afghan production companies were unable to come up with new faces to re-version the advert for the Afghan market. Just 13 years ago, young men were unable to were the kind of outfits on show here. The Taliban enforced a strict dress code of traditional clothes (Pirahan-Tunban) and even youngsters were not allowed to style their hair or  beards. Short hair, long beards, a white cap and turban where the norm. All that has changed and today there are numerous shopping malls in Kabul offering  Western clothing brands. Shop windows feature short-sleeved ladies dresses which women wear at private parties and indoor, female-only wedding ceremonies. Men, too, ask for Western brands and while in most parts of the country the burka and traditional dress is the norm, in the centre of Kabul you find girls and boys with modern dress and style. But despite the changes, conservative traditions still set strict limits for any aspiring fashion model, especially women. Only a few young women turned up for the fashion shoot and all declined to talk to me. Women appearing on TV is a red line for many families, never mind modelling, despite the presence of many female television anchors on various stations. It's a problem for producers and directors who often have to opt for Iranian, Pakistani and Tajik actors and models. "Afghan actors and actresses are not flexible with roles," says Roya Sadat, the owner of Roya Film House, who has years of experience in Afghan movies, TV series and video shoots. She says that the most difficult part of filming is casting, especially casting for female roles. "When we want to cast actresses, sometimes  they read the script, and when they find a scene unusual, they refuse to take part," Roya Sadat says. "Unusual" refers to scenes which may upset conservative audiences. "In one of my TV series there was a scene where I showed a husband and wife at bed time," Roya recalls. She says that, knowing the sensitivities, they decided to turn the lights off in the scene as soon as the couple lay down. But it still was too much for some, Roya says: "When the series was broadcast, the actress called me and said that she was beaten by her family, who wanted to know what had happened when the lights went off!" Roya says that despite such incidents, there's been much change over the past decade and things are getting easier for models and actors. Aspiring models like Fayaz hope to use these new freedoms. He says he hopes that the new modelling register will open up opportunities and establish a professional industry in Afghanistan. "There are many aspiring models like me in Kabul and in other provinces of the country," Fayaz says: "But we are not organised, so having a professional agency will bring us all together so we can become more established. ".
Steve Stricker and Jim Furyk will also be joining Tom Lehman as vice-captains for the contest against Europe. Woods, 39, who is struggling to overcome a chronic back injury, has competed in seven Ryder Cups, the latest in 2012 under Love's leadership. "After I am completely healed, I intend to attempt to earn a spot on the team," stated Woods, a winner of 14 major championships. Nonetheless, I am thrilled to collaborate with Davis, the other vice-captains, and the players to secure a win for the US." " If Woods, currently ranked 384 in the world, earns a spot as a player, whether automatically or through a captain's pick, Love can choose a substitute vice-captain. The US will be bidding to end a run of eight defeats by Europe in the last 10 editions of the biennial team competition when the 2016 Ryder Cup is held from 30 September to 2 October at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota. Love, who will name a fifth vice-captain at a later date, said: "These three guys, joining Tom Lehman, will send a message to our team that we are really serious about this Ryder Cup. "We are ahead of the game this time and it lets potential team members know that we are going to do whatever it takes to put them in the best position to win in 2016. ".
The move follows Rome's decision not to bid for the 2024 Olympics and it leaves Ireland, France and South Africa in the running to stage the tournament. "Our candidacy was closely linked to the Olympic bid," stated Alfredo Gavazzi, president of the Italian Rugby Federation. "Per the agreement with the government and Olympic committee, we are unable to make the required commitments to progress." " He added: "We remain convinced of the strength of our bid and are well aware of the benefits that hosting the Rugby World Cup would have brought to Italy. We regret missing out on a great opportunity to showcase our values and our sport in our nation, but we must reluctantly acknowledge that we are unable to continue pursuing our bid. Ireland officially launched their bid in December 2014 and a final decision on the hosts will be made in November next year. As well as the traditional rugby stadiums such as the Aviva in Dublin, the Kingspan at Ravenhill in Belfast and Thomond Park in Limerick, a 2023 World Cup in Ireland would also hope to utilise a number of impressive Gaelic football venues, including the 82,300-capacity Croke Park in Dublin.

Science fiction has turned into reality more often than not. According to a report from the Royal Society and the British Academy, instead of having three principles, there should only be one main rule that regulates the intelligent machines we will soon coexist with: "Humans should flourish. " " According to Prof Dame Ottoline Leyser, who co-chairs the Royal Society's science policy advisory group, human flourishing should be the key to how intelligent systems governed. "This was the term that really encapsulated what we wanted to say," she told BBC News. "The thriving of people and communities needs to be put first, and we think Asimov's principles can be subsumed into that. " The report calls for a new body to ensure intelligent machines serve people rather than control them. It says that a system of democratic supervision is essential to regulate the development of self-learning systems. Without it they have the potential to cause great harm, the report says. It is not warning of machines enslaving humanity, at least not yet. But when systems that learn and make decisions independently are used in the home and across a range of commercial and public services, there is scope for plenty of bad things to happen. The report calls for safeguards to prioritise the interests of humans over machines. The development of such systems cannot by governed solely by technical standards. They also have to be imbued with ethical and democratic values, according to Antony Walker, who is deputy chief executive of the lobby group TechUK and another of the report's authors. "There are many benefits that will come out of these technologies, but the public has to have the trust and confidence that these systems are being thought through and governed properly," he said. The report calls for a completely new approach. It suggests a "stewardship body" of experts and interested parties should build an ethical framework for the development of artificial intelligence technologies. Four overarching principles are suggested to enhance human well-being, and there is an immediate necessity for a different approach to regulating machines. The era of Asimov has arrived. The development of autonomous vehicles, for example, raises questions about how human safety should be prioritised. What happens in a situation where the machine has to choose between the safety of those in the vehicle and pedestrians? There is also the issue of determining liability if there is an accident. Was it the fault of the vehicle owner or the machine? Another example is the emergence of intelligent systems for personalised tuition. These identify a student's strengths and weaknesses and teach accordingly. Should such a self-learning system be able to teach without proper guidelines? How do we make sure that we are comfortable with the way in which the machine is directing the child, just as we are concerned about the way in which a tutor teaches a child? These issues are not for the technology companies that develop the systems to resolve, they are for all of us. It is for this reason that the report argues that details of intelligent systems cannot be kept secret for commercial reasons. They have to be publicly available so that if something starts to goes wrong it can be spotted and put right. Current regulations focus on personal data. But they have nothing to say about the data we give away on a daily basis, through tracking of our mobile phones, our purchasing preferences, electricity smart meters and online "likes". There are systems that can piece together this public data and build up a personality profile that could potentially be used by insurance companies to set premiums, or by employers to assess suitability for certain jobs. Such systems can offer huge benefits, but if unchecked we could find our life chances determined by machines. The key, according to Prof Leyser, is that regulation has to be on a case-by-case basis. "An algorithm to predict what books you should be recommended on Amazon is a very different thing from using an algorithm to diagnose your disease in a medical situation," she told the BBC. "So, it is not sensible to regulate algorithms as a whole without taking into account what it is being used for. " The Conservative Party promised a digital charter in its manifesto, and the creation of a data use and ethics commission. While most of the rhetoric by ministers has been about stopping the internet from being used to incite terrorism and violence, some believe that the charter and commission might also adopt some of the ideas put forward in the data governance report. The UK's Minister for Digital, Matt Hancock, told the BBC that it was "critical" to get the rules right on how we used data as a society. "Data governance, and the effective and ethical use of data, are vital for the future of our economy and society," he said. "We are committed to continuing to work closely with industry to get this right. " Fundamentally, intelligent systems will take off only if people trust them and how they are regulated. Without that, the enormous potential these systems have for human flourishing will never be fully realised. Follow Pallab on Twitter.
After his opening win on Friday, Mitchell-Thomas, 20, clinched another Supersport victory on Saturday before winning the Open Race. Ryan Farquhar won the Supertwins class on his KMR Kawasaki, with Mitchell-Thomas having to settle for second. Ballymena's Neil Kernohan won a 250cc race which had to be shortened. Mitchel-Thomas, a previous Supermoto competitor, emerged victorious in the Supersport 600 race held on Friday night under wet weather conditions, with Michael Sweeney coming in second place. The champion of the Senior Manx Grand Prix in the previous year also crossed the finish line ahead of the Skerries man in the Supersport race on Saturday. Representing John Burrows Cookstown BE Racing team, Mitchell-Thomas passed team-mate Sheils to win the Open race, with Sweeney coming in third and early leader Ryan Farquhar finishing fourth. The meeting was missing from the calendar in 2014 and 2015 because of financial limitations but returned as the first Irish road race of the new season. For many years, the Mid Antrim was staged in August, although a June date was experimented with in 2012, before the event reverted back to its usual August date the following season. The Tandragee 100 will be held on 22-23 April, with the Cookstown 100 a week later.
Born in Crowborough, East Sussex, Dr Sellers began working for the US space agency as a scientist in 1982 before joining its astronaut corps in 1996. The climate expert made three Space Shuttle flights to the International Space Station, between 2002 and 2010. Nasa said Dr Sellers, who was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer in 2015, died in Houston on Friday. British astronaut Tim Peake - who completed a six-month mission on the International Space Station in June - tweeted that he was "saddened to hear the loss" of Dr Sellers, and added he was a "true inspiration". Dr Sellers became a naturalised US citizen in 1991, making him eligible for the space programme. In January this year, he wrote a op-ed article for the New York Times about grappling with the meaning of the earth's fragility after learning he had terminal cancer. He later shared an astronaut's perspective on climate change in Leonardo DiCaprio's documentary, Before the Flood. When given a terminal cancer diagnosis, many people draw up a "bucket list" - a series of places or activities they want to experience before they die. Piers rejected such an idea; he simply wanted to keep on working at his job for as long as he could. After all, that job had already afforded him the opportunity to do and see things most others could only dream of. Ever thoughtful, supremely engaging - it was always a pleasure to talk to him, whether that was about his passion for Earth science or the exhilaration he felt doing a spacewalk (his six spacewalks are the most to be completed by any Briton). Having left Britain to become a US citizen in order to pursue his ambition of being an astronaut, you might think he had left thoughts of his country of birth far behind. But whenever we spoke by phone there was always a long preamble in which he would first want to hear news of the UK, its people and politics. We use trite sayings on such occasions like "he had a great innings" - and he did. But with Piers there was a sense also that he was at the start of something big with his newfound voice in climate advocacy. Very definitely there was some unfinished business, and I strongly urge you to read his extraordinary op-ed article in the New York Times last January. In a statement, Nasa administrator Charles Bolden paid tribute to Dr Sellers, the deputy director of the agency's sciences and exploration division in Greenbelt, Maryland. "Piers was dedicated to all facets of exploration," he said. "His curiosity and drive to uncover new knowledge was generously shared with audiences around the world, both from space and in wide travels to reach as many people as possible with an essential understanding of our fragile planet. " Many of the scientist's former colleagues have paid tribute to Dr Sellers online. US astronaut Garrett Reisman - who flew with Dr Sellers on a 2010 Atlantis Space Shuttle mission - shared a picture of the pair on the International Space Station. He wrote that the Edinburgh-educated scientist "was the best of us". Former ISS assembly manager Beth Moses shared a picture of Dr Sellers on a spacewalk in 2002, when he helped install trusses on to the space station, and added the scientist was filled with "eternal optimism and laughter". Dr Sellers earned a degree in ecology from the University of Edinburgh and a doctorate in biometeorology from the University of Leeds before moving to the US. University of Leeds Vice-Chancellor Sir Alan Langlands said: "He cared deeply about our fragile planet and the people who inhabit it - his outstanding work and our fond memories of him will continue to inspire future generations. " In 2002, Dr Sellers became only the third Briton to go into space - after Helen Sharman and Michael Foale - when he completed an 11-day mission to the International Space Station. His journey aboard the shuttle Atlantis saw him carry out three spacewalks to help continue the assembly of the ISS. Dr Sellers's next flight was aboard Discovery in 2006, a mission designed to test improved safety measures following the 2003 Columbia disaster, in which seven astronauts died. In May 2010, Dr Sellers took his second trip to Atlantis to transport a Russian-made module to the space station. Throughout his three shuttle missions, he accumulated extensive time in space, completing six spacewalks, as detailed in his Nasa biography. In 2011, he was appointed an OBE in the Queen's New Year's Honours List. In July this year, Dr Sellers was awarded Nasa's Distinguished Service Medal, the agency's highest honour.
In response, the US embassy in the capital Kingston asked Marlene Malahoo Forte to explain her legal reasoning. Forty-nine people died when a gunman opened fire in a gay club in Florida. Jamaica has laws criminalising gay sex and rights groups have warned LGBT face frequent discrimination. The embassy in Kingston joined other US missions around the world in flying the rainbow flag in solidarity with the victims of the attack, the worst mass shooting in recent US history. The flag symbolises the diversity of the LGBT movement. Orlando shooting: Special report In a post that now appears to have been deleted, Ms Malahoo Forte said: "I strongly condemn #OrlandoNightClubShooting but find it disrespectful of Jamaica's laws to have #RainbowFlag flown here. #MyPersonalView. " The US embassy replied: "We're listening. Explain the legal reasoning? It was an attack of terror !!and!! hate, targeting the LGBT community". She received negative feedback on social media, where people accused her of being uninformed and prejudiced. One Facebook comment stated that she was entitled to her opinions because she was in her own country, not in America. A letter to the Jamaica Observer warned the attorney general was painting the country in a bad light while saying no one was asking Ms Malahoo Forte "to condone homosexuality". The bullet of terrorism does not differentiate, it does not recognize gender, class, or sexual orientation. We all grieve the 49 lives lost," he tweeted.
The renowned writer is known for writing novels such as The Handmaid's Tale, Cat's Eye, and The Blind Assassin. British composer Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, who holds the title of Master of the Queen's Music, has also received recognition. The academy, established in 1898, is made up of writers, musicians, artists, and architects. Additionally, renowned individuals like cellist Yo Yo Ma, actress Meryl Streep, and directors Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese are also members. Italian writer Roberto Calasso, Canadian musician Raymond Murray Schafer, and Japanese designer Kazuyo Sejima have also been appointed as honorary foreign members. Renowned literary editor Robert Gottlieb has also been recognized with the Distinguished Service to the Arts award. Gottlieb worked on classics like Joseph Heller's Catch-22 and is former editor of The New Yorker.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said cuts should be put on hold to study the impact on those affected and at least three years of transitional help given. Labour would "not make political capital" out of a full U-turn, he said. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said Labour had no "credible alternative" and the "policy wasn't changing". She told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that Chancellor George Osborne was in "listening mode", ahead of a series of key votes on the issue in the House of Lords on Monday, where the government does not have a majority and faces possible defeat. But she said she was not aware of any discussions about watering down the changes and it was important that the "overall package" offered by the government, including a new living wage, more free childcare and a higher personal income tax allowance, was taken into account. The government is coming under sustained pressure to rethink the plans, which opponents say could take more than £1,000 per year away from millions of low-income working families from April. On Monday, peers will vote on a rarely-used "fatal motion" tabled by the Lib Dems which would scrap the proposed changes entirely. Labour is backing a rival motion which calls for the changes to be delayed pending an independent analysis of their impact and until transitional assistance is put in place, while a third motion put forward by Church of England bishops expresses regret but would allow the changes to pass. Mr McDonnell denied Labour's motion would effectively also kill off any changes to the £30bn tax credit bill. "No, I think it is a real offer to George Osborne to see if we can make sure people are properly protected," he told Andrew Marr. "This is becoming above politics. I know what a U-turn looks like and how it can do damage to you but we need a U-turn on this. "These are people who go to work, look after their kids, do everything asked of them and they are going to lose on average £1,300 a year. 200,000 children could be forced into poverty as a result of this. Out there right across society, people are saying this is unacceptable. " Mr McDonnell said he had written to Mr Osborne to make clear that if the government changed tack now, Labour would "co-operate" in future efforts to review the tax credit bill, as long as it was done "at the right time and in the right way". He writes that Mr Osborne will have to do a full u-turn on this issue. He wrote: "It must not be a deception. Not a limited turnaround that garners attention but still leaves individuals in a worse position or imposes additional hardships on middle and lower income individuals or the most disadvantaged in our community. You need to drop this policy completely. " "If the Lords do throw this out tomorrow and put it back to the government, I've said to him 'If you change your mind, bring back a policy in which people are protected, not a political stunt but a real protection, we will not in any way attack you for that. He said, "We will indeed back you. " However, Ms Morgan stated that the Cabinet was "in agreement" on the overhaul of tax credits, noting that they had been endorsed by MPs three times. What are tax credits and what are the changes? Tax credits are a series of benefits introduced by the last Labour government to help low-paid families. There are two types: Working Tax Credit (WTC) for those in work, and Child Tax Credit (CTC) for those with children. Under government proposals, the income threshold for Working Tax Credits - £6,420 - will be cut to £3,850 a year from April. In other words, as soon as someone earns £3,850, they will see their payments reduced. The income threshold for those only claiming CTCs will be cut from £16,105 to £12,125. The rate at which those payments are cut is also going to get faster. Currently, for every £1 claimants earn above the threshold, they lose 41p. This is known as the taper rate. But from April, the taper rate will accelerate to 48p. There will be similar reductions for those who claim work allowances under the new Universal Credit. Read more about the changes It would, she said, be "constitutionally unprecedented" for the unelected House of Lords - whose function it is to revise government legislation but which cannot change Finance Bills - to block a budgetary measure enacted via secondary, delegated legislation. "They should be very mindful about what they are doing," she said. "That is not what the Lords is about. " Defending the "broader package" of tax and welfare changes, she added: "The prime minister has made it clear the policy isn't changing. You have to accept that people keep more of the money they earn rather than being recycled through the system. "Labour wanted a mandatory living wage and that is coming in and the income tax threshold is rising too. " Lib Dem party leader Tim Farron said his peers were "well within their rights" to seek to block the changes, telling Sunday Politics that the Conservatives did not have a mandate for them as they were not included in their general election manifesto. According to parliamentary records, peers have killed off secondary legislation supported by the Commons on only five occasions since 1945: in 1968, 2000 (twice), 2007 and 2012. One constitutional expert, Peter Riddell from the Institute for Government, told Sky News that the government would "get its way" eventually but it might take some time and he expected there would be modifications to the tax credit changes to "soften the blow".
The 30-year-old took 50 wickets in the County Championship last season at an average of 28. Anyon became a member of Sussex in preparation for the 2010 season and has achieved 178 first-class wickets for the county. James Anyon has been a consistent performer for Sussex in the County Championship since joining in 2010. "I'm delighted to have signed for another two years as I'm really happy playing my cricket down here," he said. Anyon's best bowling figures in 2013 came in the victory against title-holders Durham at Hove, where he took 5-44 in the first innings. "I was satisfied with how I played this season and I am excited to assist our team in moving up the standings in the Championship next year," stated the fast bowler from Lancashire. "We have a strong squad and I think we can compete for trophies. " " Sussex cricket manager Mark Robinson said he was delighted that Anyon had extended his stay with the club. "He had a very good year last year and is a top professional who has the potential to get better with every year," Robinson said.
The 24-year-old won back-to-back Championship titles with Leigh after joining them from Castleford in 2012 and scored 133 tries in 125 games. The Giants had two bids for Brierley turned down in February. "I am grateful to have my future assured now that the difficult past few weeks are behind me," he told the club website. Honestly, the recent weeks have probably been the toughest period in my professional career. It hasn't been easy not knowing where I will be for the rest of the season, especially with a young family. I understand that playing is not guaranteed, so I need to put in the effort and earn my spot through hard work and gaining the respect of my teammates and management. ".

The five primary party leaders, Arlene Foster, Michelle O'Neill, Naomi Long, Colum Eastwood, and Mike Nesbitt, participated in the UTV debate. They disagreed over Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt's choice to allocate his second preference vote to the SDLP. The leaders also disagreed on Brexit. The Alliance leader Naomi Long labelled the Ulster Unionist party "the Lothario of Northern Ireland politics as it's hopped in and out of bed with almost every other political party". Colum Eastwood later said: "We have waited a long time for cross community voting, it doesn't make me any less of a nationalist and it doesn't make Mike Nesbitt any less of a unionist. Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, was criticized for employing scare tactics when she cautioned voters about the possibility of "Gerry Adams' Sinn Fein" winning the majority of seats. She then stated that they could move forward with their extreme plans and consider the implications for Northern Ireland," she stated. Standing next to the DUP leader, Sinn Fein's northern leader, Michelle O'Neill, accused Arlene Foster's party of displaying "arrogance and contempt" towards the institutions. "Sinn Féin didn't seek this election but it is needed because of DUP arrogance, contempt and serious allegations of corruption surrounding their RHI scandal," she added. The Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said: "This election should be a referendum on how the two parties of the executive have handled the ongoing crisis over renewable heat and their leadership over the past ten years. " "With £85,000 a day still needlessly going up in smoke I don't think voters can afford  another DUP/Sinn Fein executive. " The Alliance leader Naomi Long said it was time to transform "broken politics". "It is time to take a stand against scandal, to say enough is enough to orange and green. "No more corruption, no more cronyism, no more incompetence, just good government," she added.
The 41-year-old will receive support from fellow Englishmen Simon Beck and Jake Collin at Milan's San Siro stadium. Clattenburg, who is scheduled to officiate the FA Cup final as well, stated that he was "surprised yet extremely happy" about his appointment. The additional assistant referees chosen are Anthony Taylor and Andre Marriner from England. Viktor Kassai from Hungary will serve as the fourth official. "It will be a huge challenge but ultimately one that I'm massively looking forward to," said Clattenburg. I will be representing my nation and the 27,000 referees in England, and the wonderful part is that I can celebrate the achievement with my group of officials.
Gusts of nearly 80mph were recorded at Mumbles after the Met Office issued an amber "be aware" warning for wind, with a lower yellow warning for rain. Large sections of mid Wales, such as Brecon and Rhayader, experienced a short power outage around midday. Natural Resources Wales has issued a flood warning for the Lower Dee Valley and multiple flood alerts. Western Power Distribution (WPD) said on Saturday that communities ranging across south and west Wales from Abersychan near Pontypool to Dale in Pembrokeshire had suffered localised cuts due to high winds. It said as many as 15,000 customers in mid Wales were without power for a short while at lunchtime due to debris on an overhead line. The cut affected properties in the Brecon, Llandrindod Wells and Rhayader areas but all were soon reconnected. Hundreds of homes were still without power across south and west Wales on Saturday evening but WPD said engineers were responding to fix problems as and when they arose. But ScottishPower said it had no reports of any problems in its area serving north and mid Wales. Roads have been impacted by the weather as well. Last Sunday, ten individuals had to be saved when a bus was struck by a significant wave in Newgale during strong winds and high tides along the Welsh coastline. Some sea crossings have also been affected. Irish Ferries cancelled their Swift sailings between Dublin and Holyhead on Saturday but the firm said passengers would be accommodated on its cruise ferry crossings. The Met Office issued a warning about strong southerly winds impacting south and west Wales, including areas such as Bridgend, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot, Pembrokeshire, Rhondda Cynon Taff, Swansea, and Vale of Glamorgan. Ceredigion, Gwynedd, and Anglesey were also expected to experience high winds. Large waves were also expected, while inland wind gusts of 50mph to 60mph are likely. "After a short lull, winds will increase from the southwest during the course of Saturday with severe gales affecting coastal districts, bringing gusts of 60-70mph and isolated 80mph at the most exposed locations within the amber warning area," a Met Office spokesman said. The public should be ready for disturbances in transportation and power supplies at a local level, especially when paired with the effects of intense rainfall.
Grandmother Pauline McKee was playing the Miss Kitty game at a casino when she won 185 credits, or $1. 85. But a message appeared on screen saying she had also won a bonus worth $41,797,550. The casino declined to provide the payout, claiming that the prize was the result of a computer error. Ms McKee, who has 13 grandchildren, sued the casino but the Iowa Supreme Court eventually threw out her case. "I had my doubts from the start, because that's a lot of money for a penny machine," she told the Chicago Tribune. "I was hoping to help my children out financially, but it wasn't meant to be. " The casino argued that the on-screen rules clearly indicated that "malfunction voids all pays and plays". At the time of the dispute, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission (IRGC)  secured the machine and carried out an investigation, sending the hardware and software to an independent testing laboratory. The investigators found that the software was programmed to allow a bonus of up to $10,000, but they couldn't work out how the multi-million bonus message had occurred. The machine's maker, Aristocrat Technologies, said it had been aware of this type of error in the display and suggested "component degradation over time may increase the susceptibility to this rare occurrence". The company had alerted casinos to the glitch in 2010 and recommended that they disable the bonus facility as a precautionary measure. The casino evidently had not done this. The IRGC determined that the extra payout was deemed "invalid" and that "there was a malfunction in the slot machine game." Ms McKee filed a lawsuit against the casino in 2012 alleging breach of contract and consumer fraud. The court unanimously sided with the casino in 2013, but the case dragged on when Ms McKee's lawyers argued that the IRGC had no jurisdiction in disputes between casinos and their patrons. They also questioned whether the machine had really "malfunctioned", as the IRGC had concluded, and whether she had really entered into a contract when playing the game. There have been similar cases in the US involving erroneous bonus displays. In 2009, a player "won" a bonus of $1m that had appeared on screen, only for a Mississippi court to throw out the claim. Ms McKee's courageous efforts were in vain as the Iowa Supreme Court ultimately denied her case on 24 April, with the game rules capping payouts at $8,000.
Students could earn a degree in two years instead of three, allowing them to cut down on a year's worth of living expenses. However, universities could still require students to pay the cost of three years of tuition fees for these accelerated two-year programs. This would make annual fees in England higher than many US state universities. Universities Minister Jo Johnson told university leaders such flexibility would make courses more attractive for mature students and disadvantaged youngsters who might be put off by a full three year degree. Mr Johnson said that charging three years' fees for a two-year course was fair - as this was not a dilution of quality. "It's not fewer credits, or lower quality of provision, it's the same standard, the same quality, but in a compressed period of time and that involves an increase in resources, which needs to be recognised in the fee structure," said the minister, speaking after a speech to university leaders in London. "There are clear advantages for the student," he said, such as saving a year's living costs and allowing them to get into employment more quickly. The UCU lecturers' union cautioned that private, for-profit providers could benefit the most from this, as they might choose to follow a "quantity over quality" approach. The Russell Group of top universities stated that careful thought should be given to ensure that these abbreviated courses do not have a negative impact on student learning or the overall undergraduate experience. But Universities UK said it would be "a good thing" if regulations over tuition fee limit could be changed to allow such flexibility. Labour's Gordon Marsden said: "Is it yet another example of their using their new higher education legislation as a Trojan Horse to let tuition fees rip?" There have been attempts to promote shorter courses in the past - but there has been little financial incentive for universities to run fast-track degrees if the amount they received in fees was also reduced. Concerns have also been expressed about a two-tier university system - with better-off students able to pay for a full three-year experience. The proposals, likely to be introduced by 2020, would allow universities to sign students up for a two-year degree and receive the same fee income as a three-year course. The government has announced a fee increase to £9,250 per year - and then annual increases in line with inflation - which will push a three year course above £28,000. The shorter course would see this divided over two years - but missing the third year would mean that students and their parents would face lower costs in accommodation and living expenses. This also reflects concerns about the lack of "contact time" for some university courses - with some students only receiving a few hours a week of seminars and lectures and long holidays in the summer and at Christmas. A shorter time in university would allow students to begin working at an earlier stage and repay their loan debts. Mr Johnson said that this would not mean any "flight" from the traditional three-year degree, but would provide an alternative for those wanting a different approach from a traditional three year residential degree. "Consider, for instance, an individual in their mid to late twenties, who did not attend college, who has already been working but desires an opportunity to retrain and gain new skills," the minister stated. "They are not interested in dedicating three years to studying and prefer a quicker pace of learning than what the traditional three-year model permits. " " Mr Johnson also announced plans for universities to reveal more detailed information about the attainment levels of different groups - such as ethnic minorities and disadvantaged youngsters. There are also plans to make it easier for students to move between universities or courses.
The first harvest, from Marine Harvest - then a branch of Unilever - was 15 tonnes hauled from Lochailort in Lochaber. The haul now is closer to 170,000 tonnes per year. It's been quite a success story. Scottish salmon has grown to be worth more than Â£600m at the fish farm gate, and more than a billion when it reaches retail. Two-fifths of output is sold overseas. With more than 250 salt water sites and more than 2,200 directly employed, it's celebrated as a big contributor to remote west coast communities - even if profits go elsewhere, and much of the work is now automated. A typical fish farm can now operate with six staff, whereas it used to have 24. The product carries a premium over Atlantic salmon from other producers; Norway, Canada, Chile, the Faroes and Iceland. And that's despite the strange decision of the six big producers not (yet) to get together and promote the brand in the way that Scotch lamb and beef are promoted. So surely it's great news for the economy that there the government is targeting a rise in aquaculture production to 210,000 tonnes by 2020, and a doubling in tonnage by 2030? Not everyone is so sure. Environment campaigners don't like the impact of fish farms on the surrounding environment. That includes other marine life in the loch, and above all, wild salmon migrating past the cages. They take the precautionary approach, because so much is unknown about what goes on under the surface of the water: because the industry is so young: because we're not used to this density of fish in one place: because the tide and waves are powerful, sensitive, unpredictable distributors of environmental impact. Critics make the case for pulling back on salmon production rather than letting it fly. But experts in the business end of salmon say it is already too constrained in Scotland. Whereas it was a pioneer with Norway in the 60s and 70s, its production is now a small fraction of Norway's. And Norway is where you find much of the corporate clout in this industry, with the Oslo Borse as the place for the other kind of liquid salmon stocks. Like whisky and oil, this is a success story largely owned by foreigners. According to figures from the biggest producer, Marine Harvest - now a Norway-based company - corporate earnings per kilo of salmon produced are much lower in Scotland than they are in its other producing countries. That may be for several reasons. One is the problem of sea lice, which appears to be afflicting Scotland particularly badly, with high mortality and a big cost in trying to find solutions. Within the industry, the cost is causing some alarm, but there is an expectation that a solution will be found. They have encountered challenges in the past and overcome them. They view themselves as reaching the same level as traditional farming on land, which is plagued by parasites and ticks. Farmers have had centuries of experience with livestock, which has enabled them to know how to deal with these issues. They will acknowledge in private that they expanded too quickly during the 80s and 90s, which ultimately harmed their reputation. They are currently more careful and methodical in their tactics. They have experience of the devastating impact of infection on both fish mortality and on their business, most notably in Chile, where regulation has been lax. The industry view is that low profitability in Scotland has more to do with scale. The limit for any one farm site in Scotland is 2,500 tonnes of biomass. Due to the limitation on capacity and the higher price advantage, the sector has reacted by prioritizing quality over quantity. Marine Harvest consistently utilizes more fish meal and fish oil per tonne of production compared to other producer nations. Frank Asche, a professor at the University of Florida - and formerly of Stavanger - believes Scotland has lost out because the critics of salmon farming are too influential with regulators. He cites Ireland as another country which has let caution stunt the growth of its salmon production. We are likely to see this debate opened up more widely and soon, with a Scottish government consultation on relaxing that maximum size. It's a tricky balancing act, between economic impact, jobs, export performance, the environment, an industry that can put its investment elsewhere, and campaigners who are increasingly concerned at the impact this could be having on the natural environment.
The LEADER scheme is a European Union and Scottish government programme administered by a local action group. It aims to support small and micro businesses, farm diversification projects and social enterprises. The main areas it aims to enhance are "hospitality, cuisine, artistic sectors and sustainable energy". Councilman Stuart Bell was thrilled with the funding, describing it as excellent news for the area that would help stimulate the economy. "We have seen numerous projects in the past that have flourished thanks to funding from the LEADER programme, and I believe we will continue to see more success stories now that the fund is accepting new applications," he said. The scheme has the following funding available: It is anticipated that the fund will begin awarding the first grants in June 2016.
No British victims have been officially identified but the names of some were confirmed by friends and family. It comes as the relatives of others still missing since the gun attack near Sousse desperately await any news of their loved ones. More than 1,000 British tourists have returned to the UK, while it is thought 2,500 more could fly home on Sunday. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May is to chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee later. Tunisian student Seifeddine Rezgui, 23, who has links with Islamic State, opened fire on tourists at noon on Friday. Rezgui fired shots on the beach at the Imperial Marhaba and Bellevue hotels. The attack ended when he was shot dead by police. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered close to the scene a day after the attack for a rally against terrorism, with some holding candles and others carrying flags of the UK and Tunisia. Further details have been emerging about those who lost their lives in the shooting, which was described as the most significant terrorist attack on British people since 52 were killed in the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The UK government has warned the death toll will rise in the Tunisia attack. Among those so far confirmed dead by family or friends are: One Belgian and one German have so far been identified among the dead, the health ministry said. There were also thought to be Tunisians and French killed in the attack. At least 36 people were injured, some seriously. 'Only just sinking in' Adrian Evans, from the West Midlands, was described as popular by his long-standing employer. "Adrian was a lovely man. I've already been inundated from members of the council and other officers offering condolences to the family. He was well liked. He worked with us for a very, very long time and it's frankly only just sinking in," said Darren Cooper, leader of Sandwell Council, where Mr Evans worked. Joel Richards, a student at the University of Worcester, was described as a "talented" local football referee, who had "the world at his feet". "He was highly thought of and will be sadly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this tragic time," added Birmingham County FA. Walsall FC stated that both Mr Evans and Mr Richards were supporters of the team, and posted on Twitter that other fans who wanted to could leave scarves at the stadium starting Monday. The couple Sue Davey and Scott Chalkley were also honored, with their sons using Twitter to search for them after the attack. Ms Davey's son Conor Fulford, posting on Twitter on Saturday night to confirm the death of his mother, said: "Love you always Mom, I've got my teddy bear you got me tonight, Rest easy xxxx" Mr Chalkley's son Ross Naylor wrote: "I want to say thanks to everyone who has helped, you have all been amazing. One love to all and rest in peace dad. " Other relatives of those still missing continue to face an agonising wait for information. Daniel Welch, from Swindon in Wiltshire, has not heard from his grandfather John Welch, 74 and his partner Eileen Swannack, 70 since the attack. He said the hardest thing was "not knowing", adding: "We are at a bit of a loss and we can only expect the worst. " The family of Denis and Elaine Thwaites, from Blackpool, Lancashire, are appealing for information about their whereabouts. The retired couple, aged 70 and 69, arrived in Sousse on Wednesday and had been staying at the Marhaba. Their son-in-law Danny Clifford said news the family had received telling them Mr and Mrs Thwaites were in hospital was proved to be misinformation. "We are absolutely frantic," he added. The UK government has warned the death toll is likely to rise because several people had been "seriously injured" in the attack. It also warned further terrorist attacks in Tunisia, including in resort areas, were possible, "including by individuals who are unknown to the authorities". It previously emerged that the gunman - who began his attack by posing as a swimmer but was carrying a rifle under a parasol - was not known to the authorities beforehand. His parents, sister and close friends have been detained by the Tunisian authorities. Many of the tourists in the affected hotels have left the country or are waiting for specially arranged flights - however others said they would stay. Thomson and First Choice said some 5,400 of their customers remain in Tunisia, with up to 2,500 expected to return to the UK on Sunday. An additional 11 Thomson flights as well as one third-party flight with Nouvelle Air are currently due to leave later. Some holidaymakers decided not to take earlier flights to allow others to leave first. Laura Hepple, from Runcorn, who escaped the gunfire by hiding in a hotel bathroom, said: "We had a flight booked for Sunday anyway and we decided we would stick with that, have the last day of the holiday. [We're] probably [in] the safest place at the moment with armed guards around and. let those individuals with families who still have one more week remaining opt for the earlier flights.
NHS England and Public Health England have launched a campaign to help the vulnerable stay well and out of A&E. Advice consists of adjusting a thermostat to a minimum of 18C, wearing layers of clothing, and enjoying hot food and drinks. According to the Office for National Statistics, there were 43,900 more deaths during the winter months in England and Wales in 2014/15. Food is a crucial source of fuel that assists in maintaining body temperature. Aim to consume warm meals and beverages frequently during the day and stay physically active at home when possible. " There were 27% more deaths in winter in 2014/15 compared with the rest of the year, figures from the Office for National Statistics show. The majority were among those aged 75 and above with around 36,300 excess winter deaths among that age group. Research shows people with health conditions such as heart disease, lung problems and dementia are also more likely to die in winter. Professor Keith Willett, medical director for acute care at NHS England, stated that a significant number of A&E visits during the winter are a result of issues that could have been prevented if medical advice had been sought sooner. He emphasized that while the NHS is available to offer assistance, there are essential steps individuals can take to look after themselves throughout the colder months. It is crucial for individuals who are most at risk to take proactive measures to maintain their health and well-being.
Aspartame-free cans of the drink will go on sale from August in America, but not in Britain. Regulators in the UK and the US insist aspartame is still safe to use in soft drinks. PepsiCo says its decision is a commercial one - responding to consumer preferences. Last year, sales in Diet Pepsi fell by more than 5% in the US, latest figures show. Similarly, sales of Diet Coke, which also contains aspartame, decreased by more than 6%. PepsiCo plans to swap out aspartame with sucralose combined with acesulfame potassium (Ace-K). Seth Kaufman, Pepsi's vice-president, stated that aspartame is the primary factor behind the decline in diet soda consumption. " In tests, Mr Kaufman said, people still recognised the reformulated drink to be Diet Pepsi but it might have a "slightly different mouth-feel". There are no plans to change the ingredients in the UK. A spokesman said: "Consumers in the UK market love Diet Pepsi just as it is today. "Pepsi uses a variety of approved sweetener options to create great-tasting colas, including aspartame, which remains an important sweetener in some Pepsi beverages around the world, including Diet Pepsi in the UK market. " The change only applies to the US market and will affect all varieties of Diet Pepsi, such as Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi and Wild Cherry Diet Pepsi. It will not apply to other PepsiCo drinks, such as Diet Mountain Dew. Aspartame has sparked controversy since it was first approved for use in the 1980s, despite being one of the most thoroughly tested and studied food additives. Aspartame, also known as E951, is about 200 times sweeter than sugar but contains very few calories. Thousands of foods and drinks around the world use it as a sugar substitute, including breakfast cereals and sugar-free chewing gum. Food safety experts have been keeping its use under close scrutiny since a number of anecdotal reports pointed to potential side-effects. A study published by the Ramazzini Foundation in Bologna, Italy, in July 2005 claimed to have shown that rats given dosages of aspartame equivalent to those in humans may develop tumours. But European regulators who assessed this research were not convinced by it and concluded that aspartame could still be used as a food additive. The US Food and Drug Administration says there are more than 100 studies that support aspartame's safety. But regulators agree that there should be a limit to how much of the sweetener people consume. An adult would have to consume 14 cans of a sugar-free drink every day to reach this limit. Individuals with a genetic condition known as phenylketonuria or PKU are unable to consume aspartame safely. People with PKU are unable to metabolise a component of aspartame.
In Scotland, death rates for breast cancer have fallen by 33%, bowel cancer by 30%, lung cancer by 23% and prostate cancer by 11%. The statistics are released as the organization introduces a fresh advertising initiative named We Will Defeat Cancer Sooner. It urges people all over Scotland to get involved in the battle against the illness immediately. Lung, breast, bowel and prostate cancers together account for almost half of all cancer deaths in the UK every year. Cancer Research UK said breast cancer scientists had been responsible for improving detection through screening, developing more specialist care and more effective treatments such as improved surgery, radiotherapy and drugs. In Scotland, about 1,300 people died of the disease per year 20 years ago, compared with 1,000 every year now. The charity stated that research had also led to a decrease in the number of deaths among bowel cancer patients due to improved early detection and the advancement of superior treatments. Today, nearly 200 fewer Scots die from bowel cancer annually compared to two decades ago. Cancer Research UK said there had been little improvement in the outlook for those diagnosed with lung cancer, so it had made it a priority to stem lung cancer mortality through earlier diagnosis and trials for improved treatments. Advancements in care - such as surgical procedures, hormone treatment, and radiation therapy - along with earlier detection, are believed to have played a role in the decline of prostate cancer mortality rates. However, not all cancer mortality rates have seen a decrease. Mortality rates in liver, pancreatic, melanoma, oral and some digestive cancers have all increased. Lisa Adams, Cancer Research UK's spokeswoman for Scotland, said: "The latest figures highlight the good news, that research continues to save lives from cancer and offer hope that this progress will continue. "But while the death rate for the four biggest cancer killers falls, it's vital to remember that we need to do more to help bring even better results over the coming years. "There are more than 200 different forms of the disease. For some of these, the advances are less impressive, such as pancreatic, oesophageal and liver cancer. Far too many lives continue to be affected by the disease. "That's why we're calling on people across Scotland to back our new campaign and join the fight against cancer because, together, we will beat cancer. ".
Some 40,000 students sit the exam every year. For most, the worry is because they and their families feel their entire future depends on it. In Jamaica, like many places, competition to get into certain secondary schools is fierce, the Gsat exams place pupils into their top five choices by performance - and that's where Edufocal steps in. "Like in a video game students compete for the top spot. For many it is not school work, it's playing," says Gordon Swaby, the company's chief executive. "At that age they love to compete. " It's an online learning platform that's getting children to study through "gamification", making it fun to train for examinations. The firm makes studying more like a computer game, where pupils compete and their high scores are the tests results. "They start on level one on all the subjects," says Mr Swaby, and to move up they need to answer the questions correctly. "They can win prizes whether it's a movie ticket, food vouchers, mobile credit. That's the cultural element to it, Jamaicans love to win stuff, they love incentives," he says. Gordon, aged 25, started the business four years ago, but this was not his first online venture. As a teenager he launched a video game website from his rural home in central Jamaica which became one of the biggest gaming sites in the Caribbean. He now employs four people full-time and two part-time with Edufocal, as well as teachers across the country who are paid to write content for the platform. It costs about $15 (Â£10) a month for parents to buy a subscription to Edufocal. This allows pupils to access some 23,000 exams in the core subjects tested by the Gsat; maths, languages, arts, science, social studies and communication. Once on the site, they can go through hundreds of tests, get feedback on the ones they got wrong, and also see how well they're doing on a leader board - creating competition among thousands of pupils. Outside Rollington Town Primary School in downtown Kingston, Jamaica's capital, the sweet sellers are waiting to see if any of the stragglers will buy a snack. Inside the school, some more punctual pupils are already waiting outside the computer lab,  ready for an Edufocal session. In this part of the capital, most parents struggle to even buy lunch for their children, but the school works  with them and Edufocal so that all can afford to use the exam preparation platform. "Most of the parents are unemployed or they don't have internet access", says the school's head teacher, Dr Margaret Bailey. "We've done our work -  our mock exams - so we know what the weak areas are of each student. If they are weak in science we use Edufocal classes in science, those who struggle in languages, we do Edufocal classes in languages. We are familiar with their advantages and disadvantages as Edufocal provides instant feedback. Mr Swaby says that having so much debt was the "worst way" to start-up. But it soon found investment via a local tech incubator JGX Labs and support from the Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship. In the early days the company also benefitted from the support of large established Jamaican companies who saw the site as a positive - business for good in its truest sense. Edufocal is currently utilized by numerous students throughout the island. The company is now shifting its focus towards fresh markets, particularly in English-speaking Caribbean nations such as Trinidad and Barbados, as well as in West African countries like Ghana that have a similar curriculum. The company is also looking to add more features to the platform to help students and educators. "Making personalised recommendations on how pupils need to study is a really powerful, and it's something we've not had in Jamaica before," says Gordon Swaby. "All of that data is useful, not just for parents but for the Ministry of Education, as they can use it to enable students to see areas which are problematic, it's data at work and can help change the landscape of education in Jamaica.

The 27-year-old Austria international finished top scorer for the Potters in the 2015-16 season. His contract runs for four years and he is committed to the club until June 2017, however, Stoke have not yet reached a new deal with his agent based in Austria. "He is aware that we are keen for him to put pen to paper," stated chief executive Tony Scholes to BBC Stoke. "We've been great for him and he's been great for us. (Manager) Mark Hughes and the rest of the staff all want him to sign. We believe that this is the optimal location for him. "But Marko and his agent are waiting patiently" They have not come to any agreements at this point. We are optimistic that he will agree to sign, but I still cannot provide a definite answer. Arnautovic, who was signed by Hughes for an undisclosed seven-figure fee from Werder Bremen in September 2013, had his most successful season yet. Out of his 19 goals for Stoke in 110 appearances, 12 were scored this season.

James McCarthy was sent off for fouls on Yohan Cabaye and Yannick Bolasie, and Toffees keeper Joel Robles did well to keep out Jason Puncheon's effort. Everton - winless in five league games - struck the bar with a fine Ross Barkley strike before the dismissal. They stood firm in defense towards the end and currently have 40 points, which is two more than Palace. Both Palace and Everton have a solid lead over Sunderland - who are in the last relegation position with 27 points - but the draw will not ease concerns about their poor form. Look back on the goalless draw at Selhurst Park The Toffees showed application in sticking to their task after losing midfielder McCarthy, who had completed 100% of his 28 passes before the red card on 52 minutes. Robles made six saves in all but deserved credit for his stop at the feet of Puncheon, who had time and space and could have scored for the second successive game. Media playback is not supported on this device However, it was Barkley's rasping 20-yard drive off the crossbar that was easily the closest anyone came to breaking the deadlock. Everton boss Roberto Martinez - a subject of criticism from sections of the club's fanbase - was undoubtedly more pleased than his opposite number Alan Pardew. "It was a more than decent result," said Martinez. "The resilience and hard work, and to be able to be so solid, was great. "We had as many chances. Joel Robles had to be at his best but it was a level game. To play like that with 10 men, it was incredibly satisfying. " Palace struggled to carve the visitors open, despite their one-man advantage, and boss Pardew admitted himself that he expects more from his forwards. Media playback is not supported on this device Dwight Gayle attempted an audacious overhead kick in the first half which went just wide of the post, while Emmanuel Adebayor - on as a second-half substitute - looked lively in the box but lacked the killer touch. Palace earned their first league win since December on Saturday against Norwich, and Pardew said: "I would have taken four points from these last two games. but wow, we should have won that. Despite feeling frustrated, I am happy with another solid performance. I am looking for my attacking players to elevate their performance, but I am content with securing two shutout victories. " Everton host Southampton on Saturday, while Crystal Palace travel to Arsenal on Sunday.
The account, thought to have contained around Â£7m, was to be used to facilitate payments to people involved in arranging the sale. The bank account was controlled by Ian Coulter, a former partner in Belfast law firm Tughans. He left the company in January. It was to be used for payments to so-called fixers and influencers behind the sale of  Nama's Northern Ireland property portfolio. Last week, Mick Wallace, an Independent TD in Ireland, alleged in the Irish parliament that the funds were designated for a politician in Northern Ireland. Tughans has stated that the funds were "redirected" into the account without the awareness of other top employees. It said the payment was retrieved and Mr Coulter left the company at the start of the year. In a statement on Wednesday, the PSNI said it will launch a criminal inquiry into concerns raised over the Nama sale and the claims made by Mr Wallace. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said the PSNI believed there was sufficient concern in relation to potential criminal activity surrounding the property deal to instigate an investigation. He said the police were engaging with a number of other national and international law enforcement partners to consider how best to take it forward. It is understood those other law enforcement organisations include the National Crime Agency - referred to as the British FBI. In a statement on Wednesday, a DUP spokesperson said: "This is a welcome announcement and the appropriate step to deal with the serious allegations which have been made. "Indeed, the First Minister Peter Robinson called for such action by the authorities last week noting that accusations of criminal behaviour tarnish politics and should be fully investigated. " Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness said it may be necessary to have a full judicial inquiry into the Nama sale. The Law Society, which is responsible for regulating the activities of solicitors in Northern Ireland, has been investigating the circumstances of Mr Coulter's departure from Tughans since January. On Tuesday, it said it will co-operate fully with any police investigation.
The construction of a huge new deep-water shipping dock dubbed Liverpool2, which can cater for a new breed of giant container ships, is seen as a new start for the city. It forms part of the new SuperPort project extending across the north-west of England, created to revive and boost the region's industry. Liverpool's history is bound to the tides of transatlantic transportation: from the city that grew powerful and prosperous from the slave trade, to the mass migration of people seeking a better life in the new world and the age of luxury cruises. Between 1830 and 1930, Liverpool served as a primary departure point for nine million emigrants heading to North America, Australia, and New Zealand. However, with the decrease in emigration following World War One and the relocation of Cunard's luxury liner services to Southampton in 1919, the decline of the port appeared inevitable. Despite these challenges, Liverpool maintained a shipping industry and just a few weeks ago, the delivery of large new cranes from China indicated a new era in the port's extensive history. Sarah Starkey, curator of maritime and slavery archives at the Merseyside Maritime Museum, stated that the new exhibition - On the Waterfront - set to open on 25 November, traces the evolving economic fortunes of the port of Liverpool throughout the centuries. Because tankers are getting larger, Ms Starkey said Liverpool has "had to constantly build bigger docks and are still doing today". She said Albert Dock, constructed in 1846, was outgrown by the ships using it within a few decades "although the warehouses remained profitable for years". She said although Liverpool port's decline was "undeniable", large amounts of cargo were still moved in big container ships which were less labour-intensive. The redevelopment of the Albert Dock in the 1980s was the brainchild of the then Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, who helped breathe new life into the rundown warehouses which are now an entertainment and shopping hub and home to the Tate Liverpool gallery. Liverpool also saw the return of cruise liners, which traditionally sailed from Southampton, and its leaders were engaged in a verbal spat. Freelance maritime writer Peter Elson said: "The shipping industry has not died in Liverpool but as the ships have got bigger, the port has had to move further to the north of the city. " This is partly because of the River Mersey's large tidal range and fast-flowing water. He said the south docks were now "completely redundant" with only motor cruisers and yachts berthed there. With the widening of the Panama Canal, larger container ships from the Far East can now reach Liverpool much more easily, he said. Although there is some scepticism, he warned that if no action was taken Liverpool could "tumble down the second and third division" in maritime significance. Stuart Wood, a retired Pilot Ship pilot, who worked for the Port of Liverpool and retired six years ago, said when he joined in 1960 "the glory days were already threadbare". He said: "Then the container came along and British shipping wasn't ready for it. " Mr Wood said other countries took advantage of British inertia and some companies "faded away". Mr Wood described container ships as a "magic bullet" which at the same time killed the shipping industry in Liverpool. With the Liverpool2 super port around the corner, it is hoped it will once again witness a revival.
A series of tweets claiming to be from "The Legion" also gave out a London address said to belong to Mr Mallya. Mr Mallya appears to have regained control of the account and the tweets have been deleted. The entrepreneur is under investigation in India for suspected money laundering. Mr Mallya has been living in the UK since March of this year. India cancelled his passport and requested the UK to send him back in May, following an Indian court's warrant for his arrest. The tweets posted to his account included a list of luxury cars that the group claimed were owned by Mr Mallya, as well as a photograph of what appeared to be a residency permit of "unlimited" duration. The group said that the information published was just a "trailer" and that more would be released soon. This appears to be the second time the group has taken over Mr Mallya's account. The businessman appeared to regain control of the account, posting to saying that the group had "hacked" him and was attempting to blackmail him. Tweets then appeared after that denying the claims of blackmail and promising to "expose" Mr Mallya further over the coming weeks. Mr Mallya made his fortune selling beer under the Kingfisher brand and branched out into aviation, Formula 1 racing, and Indian cricket. The extravagant entrepreneur faced substantial debts following the collapse of Kingfisher airlines in 2013 and is currently being chased by a consortium primarily made up of state-owned banks that provided him with loans. He is accused of consistently evading investigators in India in relation to financial improprieties at the airline. He has refuted allegations of escaping India, stating that he is on a business trip. He has further asserted that he is being targeted unfairly by the media.
The 21-year-old was on loan at Fir Park from Everton for the second half of last season, playing four games in May. Griffiths, who has previously been loaned out to Halifax and Cheltenham, is the sixth new addition at Motherwell this summer. Manager Stephen Robinson expressed his satisfaction with Russell's positive attitude and exceptional performance in key matches at the end of last season. "Acquiring Russell's autograph is a great addition for us, and having competition for the top spot is crucial," Robinson added. " Goalkeeper Trevor Carson, 29, came on board the team in the beginning of this month after departing from Hartlepool United.
Huge crowds gathered on the route between the Rafah crossing with Egypt and Mr Assaf's home in the Khan Younis refugee camp. His victory was met with celebrations across the Palestinian territories. The contest, held in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, was watched by millions across the region. Tens of thousands of Palestinians had been waiting since the early morning to greet Mr Assaf, despite the scorching heat, the BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf reports from Gaza. It usually only takes 15 minutes to travel from the Rafah crossing to Mr Assaf's home, but his convoy ended up taking two hours because of the large crowds that had gathered, as per our correspondent's report. "I appreciate everyone's help, as I couldn't have won without your support," Mr Assaf expressed his gratitude during a news conference after his arrival, as per Reuters. Mr Assaf, 23, was a wedding singer and a virtual unknown until a few weeks ago but has now become a hero to Palestinians. Despite a perception that the Arab Idol show and its music were not appreciated by the Islamist Hamas movement which rules Gaza, Hamas officials were among those who greeted Mr Assaf. His victory was announced on Saturday evening, a day after he competed in a final against two other singers - Ahmed Jamal from Egypt and Farah Youssef from Syria. Fireworks were set off in Gaza City and East Jerusalem as revellers thronged the streets. Gaza had not seen such an outpouring of emotion since the end of last year's conflict with Israel, correspondents say. The talent contest has been broadcast on the Beirut-based MBC TV channel since March. Mr Assaf's last solo song, performed on Friday, had a political edge, asking for the Palestinian traditional scarf to be raised and calling for reconciliation. While Mr Assaf was born in Libya to Palestinian parents, it is the first time a singer living in Gaza has won the prestigious event. Palestinian public figures, including President Mahmoud Abbas, had called on all Palestinians to show their support for the singer. He is expected to get Israeli permission to travel to the West Bank so that he can perform at concerts there as well as in Gaza in the near future.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the assault began on Monday, with fighters advancing on several fronts. A monitoring organization documented confrontations in the eastern part of Raqqa and at a military base located on the northern periphery. The US-led coalition stated that the mission would deal a significant blow to the concept of [IS] as a physical caliphate. The SDF, which says it is not aligned with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or the rebel forces seeking to overthrow him, has driven IS from about 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) of northern Syria since October 2015. It has been gradually encircling Raqqa since November, at the same time as Iraqi pro-government forces have been driving IS militants out of the city of Mosul. IS seized Raqqa in early 2014, months after it became the first Syrian provincial capital to fall to the rebels in the civil war, and established its headquarters there. On Tuesday morning, SDF spokesman Talal Silo told a news conference in the village of Hazima: "We declare today the start of the great battle to liberate the city of Raqqa, the so-called capital of terrorism and terrorists. Mr Silo mentioned that SDF forces were launching an offensive on the city from three different directions and advised civilians to steer clear of the frontlines and IS positions in close proximity. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights noted that the attack commenced in the morning after intense air strikes by the coalition forces throughout the night. The UK-based monitoring group said the SDF was attacking the eastern Mishlab district and the Division 17 military base, north of the city centre. The anti-IS activist group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, said rockets and shells had been falling on Mishlab and Qitar Street since Monday night. US commander Lt Gen Steve Townsend said the battle would be "long and difficult", but that the coalition and its partners were "steadily dismantling the physical caliphate of [IS]". "It's hard to convince new recruits that [IS] is a winning cause when they just lost their twin 'capitals' in both Iraq and Syria. " "We all saw the heinous attack in Manchester," he added. "[IS] threatens all of our nations, not just Iraq and Syria, but in our own homelands as well. This cannot stand. " The coalition, which has deployed special forces personnel to train and advise SDF fighters on the ground, believes there are between 3,000 and 4,000 IS militants holed up inside Raqqa. It is not clear how many fighters the SDF has deployed around Raqqa. However, the SDF has about 50,000 fighters in total, with Arabs making up about 60% of the force and Kurds 40%, according to the coalition. The US recently stated that it had started supplying weapons to Kurdish fighters in the SDF, which is mainly led by the YPG. The Turkish government criticized this decision. It considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey. The coalition has also stepped up air strikes around Raqqa in recent weeks, which has led to a rise in reported civilian deaths. On Monday, the Syrian Observatory and Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said an air strike had killed at least 17 civilians, including women and children, as they tried to escape Raqqa by crossing the River Euphrates in small boats. The UN says 100,000 people have been displaced by the fighting around Raqqa since April. Inside the city, food prices are said to have increased significantly. Water is reportedly available for only four hours per day on average, and there are shortages of medical services, supplies and staff.
The 22-year-old ex-Wales Under-21 athlete departed from the Swans earlier this year following just one senior outing in an FA Cup loss to Oxford United in 2016. Nonetheless, he enjoyed periods on three distinct loan spells at Yeovil, participating in a combined 72 matches for the Glovers. Shephard, mainly a right-back, is the seventh addition to the Posh squad this summer. Posh manager Grant McCann informed the club website that Liam is a fine young man with a positive personality who has fully embraced the team's values in recent weeks, which was crucial. McCann expressed his satisfaction in Liam's ability to play in various positions and is pleased with the successful completion of the deal.

Media playback is not supported on this device In the final FA Cup game at Upton Park before the Hammers move to the Olympic Stadium, visiting manager Louis van Gaal once again engineered a result when he needed it most. Marcus Rashford gave Van Gaal's men the lead in this quarter-final replay after 54 minutes, the 18-year-old collecting a pass from Anthony Martial before curling a magnificent finish into the top corner past West Ham keeper Darren Randolph. And when Marouane Fellaini bundled in Martial's cross 13 minutes later it looked all over - only for West Ham to mount a fierce siege in the closing minutes. Relive Man Utd's win over West Ham FA Cup more important to Man Utd than me - Van Gaal Visiting keeper David de Gea, who gave a virtuoso display, had already saved superbly from Michail Antonio when James Tomkins stooped bravely among flying footwear to head in and give West Ham hope with 11 minutes left. The hosts finally hammered at Manchester United's defence with De Gea saving once more from Andy Carroll and Cheikhou Kouyate, the latter ruled narrowly offside as he headed in a rebound. With Wayne Rooney coming on for the final four minutes in his first appearance in two months after a knee injury, it ended as a very satisfactory night for Van Gaal and his side. Manchester United defender Phil Jones described this tie as a "defining moment" in their season - and manager Van Gaal has had plenty of those as he has been surrounded by speculation about his future. Media playback is not supported on this device And in this managerial high-wire act, Van Gaal has always seemed able to steady a stumble by pulling out a result when he needed it most. Van Gaal has fought off his critics with crucial wins at Liverpool and Manchester City as well as progressing in the FA Cup - and the heat was on again here after the comprehensive 3-0 loss at Tottenham on Sunday and more reports of player unrest at his methods. There was no sign of discord here in a performance that showed control for the first 70 minutes and grit for the last 20 to send United to Wembley and offer Van Gaal the chance to answer his critics with a trophy. Media playback is not supported on this device De Gea will rightly take the plaudits for another display of the kind that has offered his side some respite in their darkest moments - but Van Gaal's willingness to risk young talent paid a rich dividend here. Youngster Rashford was replaced at half-time at White Hart Lane, his manager unhappy with his performance, but he produced the moment of class that shifted the emphasis and momentum in United's favour here. As he did when scoring the winner at Manchester City, Rashford showed a clinical edge and natural talent to score that wonderful opener. And in defence, Timothy Fosu-Mensah showed tremendous maturity, a tower of strength when the Red Devils needed him most. He was powerful in the air and in the tackle. Manchester United have had their difficulties, but in these two 18-year-olds and Martial they have talent they can build around. Danny Mills - take Rashford to Euro 2016 There has been a feeling around the Boleyn Ground that West Ham's name was on the FA Cup this season as they pursued silverware in their last season at the stadium. Maybe there was a touch of complacency in feeling they had done the hard part with the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford - or perhaps nerves that the dream might be coming close to reality. Whatever the reason, it was not until the last 15 minutes that they actually started playing to their strengths, using Carroll and bombarding their opponents. Even then, with the visitors on the rack, their decision-making was poor on a night that will be a bitter disappointment to manager Slaven Bilic, his players and everyone at the club. In the closing moments, with Carroll winning everything in the air, they tried an elaborate corner routine that ended with captain Mark Noble shooting yards off target.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the fall in output was largely due to a drop in mining and quarrying, after maintenance delays at the UK's largest North Sea oil field. The economy had grown by 0. 9% in the previous quarter, boosted by the London 2012 Olympic Games. For the whole year, growth was flat. The ONS said that the "bumpy economy" was on a "sluggish trend". Manufacturing fell by 1. 5% in the fourth quarter, the services sector was flat, but construction output rose by 0. 3%. Within the manufacturing sector, mining and quarrying output fell by 10. 2%, the biggest decline since records began in 1997, driven by disruption to North Sea oil and gas fields. The Buzzard oil field, about 100 kilometres north east of Aberdeen, was shut in early September for maintenance work that was expected to take about 28 days, according to reports. But Buzzard resumed production in early November, and it was not until the end of that month that full capacity was reached. Buzzard, run by Nexen and with BG Group a 21. 7% shareholder, is one of the biggest North Sea fields to be developed in 10 years. The field holds enough crude potentially to deliver about 10% of the UK's annual forecast oil demand. Nexen declined to comment on the maintenance work's impact on the GDP figures, but added: "The shutdowns occur every five years, are planned, and are required in order to comply with regulatory requirements. The shutdowns enable us to repair and upgrade equipment that cannot be accessed when the facilities are operating. " If oil and gas extraction were excluded from the overall gross domestic product (GDP) calculations, then the data would have shown that the economy shrank by only 0. 1% in the fourth quarter, the ONS said. GDP is the sum of all goods and services made in the economy. This is the first estimate of how the economy performed in the fourth quarter, and is subject to at least two further revisions as more data is collected. Still job hunting, 18 months on Chancellor George Osborne said the figures were a reminder that the UK faces "a very difficult economic situation". He described them as "a reminder that last year was particularly difficult, that we face problems at home with the debts built up over many years, and problems abroad with the eurozone, where we export many of our products, deep in recession". "Now we can either run away from those problems or we can confront them. And I'm determined to confront them so we can go on creating jobs for the people of this country," Mr Osborne said. But Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "Today's news confirms what business leaders, retailers and families have known for many months - that depressed confidence and a chronic shortage of demand mean our economy continues to flat line. "This government's failing plan has now seen our economy stagnate for over two years and borrowing is now rising as a result. " Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: "We are now mid-way through the coalition's term of office and its economic strategy has been a complete disaster. "The economy has grown by just 1%, real wages have fallen, and the manufacturing and construction sectors have shrunk. We remain as dependent on the City as we did before the financial crash. " If the economy were to also shrink in the first three months of 2013, then the UK would re-enter recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The CBI business group said it expected growth "to continue to be fairly flat through the winter but momentum will gradually build later in the year, as the global economy picks up a little and confidence lifts". Capital Economics believes another contraction in the first quarter is "quite possible. Particularly considering the snow disturbance. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent financial watchdog, has forecast growth of 1. 2% this year, slightly above most other independent forecasts. Earlier this week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cut its growth forecast for the UK to 1% from 1. 1%, but this is a rosier picture compared with its outlook for the eurozone, which it expects to shrink by 0. 1% this year. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor The ONS data for the fourth quarter showed the drop-off in activity in the services sector following the end of the  Olympics and Paralympics. Services make up about three-quarters of the UK's economic activity. In the third quarter of the year - when the Olympics and Paralympics took place - the sector grew by 1. 2%. The ONS said there was some evidence of "fallback" in the fourth quarter, seen in the hotel and restaurant industries and in land transport. The biggest impact, though, was in sports activities, amusement and recreation, which dropped 22. 5%. This was mainly due to increased ticket sales for the Games in the third quarter, and contributed 0. 2 percentage points to the fall in overall GDP in the fourth quarter. Across the year as a whole, services grew by 1. 2% , while total industrial production fell by 2. 5% and construction dropped by 9. 3%. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said there were "no positive takeaways" from the figures. "Even assuming some unwinding of activity from the Olympics boost in the previous quarter, this still leaves no real signs of underlying growth in the economy. "The news from industry was particularly weak, with November's sharp drop on output contributing to a rather grim fourth quarter and leaving the overall picture for manufacturing in 2012 the weakest since 2009. " Economists at IHS Global Insight noted that GDP in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 3. 3% below the peak level seen in the first quarter of 2008. They estimate that it will not return to that level until the first half of 2015 - a gap of seven years. The government's economic policies came under focus on Thursday when the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that the chancellor should consider slowing down austerity measures in his March budget, because of their effect on growth. "We think this would be a good time to take stock," Olivier Blanchard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But Mr Osborne later rebuffed Mr Blanchard's advice. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he said that spending cuts must continue if the government is to retain its credibility. "We have a credible and flexible debt reduction plan. That credibility is very hard won and easily lost," he said. However, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has said that the coalition made a mistake in cutting back capital spending when it came to office. He told The House magazine that ministers had reassured themselves at the time that the reduction was in line with plans drawn up by Labour. But they now realised investment in infrastructure was crucial for economic recovery, he added. When asked about Mr Clegg's views, Mr Osborne responded: "What Nick Clegg has said is that capital investment is important and I agree with that, which is why we have added £20bn of capital investment to our plans over the last couple of years. "But you can only do that if you have convinced the world that you can pay your way - that investors have confidence in the UK. We've got that confidence. ".
Traffic in the town came to a standstill while farmers showed their support alongside school children, sports clubs, businesses and health workers. They walked two miles through the town. Since January 2014, the Downe Hospital's accident and emergency department has been shut down on weekends due to a lack of certified emergency physicians. Bed numbers have been reduced in other wards as well. The hospital, which was officially opened in June 2010, is facing continuous budget cuts, according to organizers. SDLP MP for South Down Margaret Ritchie has urged the executive to pay attention to "the will of the people" regarding the future of the hospital. "This march was extremely successful and sends a clear message to the Health Minister that he must restore, enhance and develop services at the Downe," she said. "The people who showed their support here today will not accept anything less. " The rally organisers want to see the return of a full-time accident and emergency cover, as well as the recovery of coronary care and other wards.
Speaking after a riot at Birmingham prison, Nick Hardwick said there was only "a small window" in which to act. The Ministry of Justice is recruiting an additional 2,500 prison officers to tackle prison violence. But Mr Hardwick told the BBC the situation was "very grave" and it would be too long before the extra staff were trained and effective. Mr Hardwick, formerly Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend programme that there were widespread fears of violence in the prison system. HMP Birmingham, where inmates took over four wings and started fires on Friday, had not even been among the institutions causing the most concern, he said. "The levels of violence and suicide and self-harm are not only increasing, but the rate at which they are increasing is accelerating. "Successive ministers cannot say that they were not warned about this. " A gold command centre set up by the National Offender Management Service when trouble broke out in Birmingham is still in operation and continuing to monitor any signs of potential disturbance there and elsewhere. The BBC understands there was a brief disturbance at Hull prison involving a number of inmates transferred from Birmingham, and one wing was in lock-down for up to two hours. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "HMP Hull, like all prisons across the estate, is being closely monitored for signs of potential unrest. "We have specially trained prison staff available to respond to any disturbances. " Last month, Justice Secretary Liz Truss announced a Â£1. 3bn investment in new prisons, as well as more prison officers, extra drug tests and greater autonomy for governors. She has also promised a zero-tolerance approach to attacks on prison staff and said body-worn cameras would be provided at jails across the country. But Mr Hardwick said the government must take urgent action to reduce the prison population of 85,000 to a more manageable figure. "We are not prepared to pay for the size of the prison population that we now have, so the balance between the prison population and the number of staff that we've got is now unworkable," he said. "It would be a mistake to take emergency, reckless measures around the prison population. If you fail to conduct tasks in an organized and logical manner, you might find yourself in a more challenging situation later on. Alex Cavendish, a former inmate now working as an academic and managing the Prison UK blog, expressed his worries to the BBC that simply hiring more prison officers would not solve the issue. "I'm not convinced that they will be able to retain them, or that they will be able to get them deployed, trained effectively, onto wings in time to stop the next round of riots. "And I am very, very much afraid that we are going to see more of this disturbance. Mercifully, at Birmingham nobody was seriously injured or killed, but that cannot be ruled out in the future. ".
The crash happened at about 22:40 on Saturday on the city's Telford Road. The person was saved from the rubble by firemen and taken by ambulance to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Medic One, a team of medical experts from the hospital, was also on site.
The 13th year of the festival in Ullapool will be celebrated with a fresh layout on 29 and 30 September, kicking off with the reveal of this performance and additional acts to be announced. This year, the event will be held on the town's pier for the first time, as the organizers were not able to secure the usual venue. Due to the new location, there will be no campsite and ticket availability will be limited. Loopallu has featured artists like Paolo Nutini, Franz Ferdinand, Mumford and Sons, and Jake Bugg over the past 12 years. Last year's festival's headliners included The Wonder Stuff and The Stranglers.
*An independent report revealed nurses were regularly under pressure and there was poor communication with families. It follows the deaths of at least seven children, who were treated on Ward 32. However, the review said there was no evidence to suggest failings on the scale of a previous inquiry in 2001 into baby heart deaths in Bristol. The report made a series of recommendations to the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, NHS England and the Department of Health. It also recommended NHS England should commission a review of paediatric intensive care services across England. The report found no evidence to suggest there were failures in care and treatment of the nature identified in the 2001 public inquiry, which found 35 babies died and dozens more were left brain-damaged between 1991 and 1995 at Bristol Royal Infirmary. The outcomes of care at the children's hospital were "broadly comparable" with those of other centres caring for children with congenital heart disease, the report said. The review was launched in 2014 after the parents of four-year-old Sean Turner, who died in March 2012, tweeted the NHS's medical director. Steve and Yolanda Turner, from Wiltshire, pleaded with Prof Sir Bruce Keogh to "sort this out" after a coroner ruled the hospital had not failed Sean. He suffered a brain haemorrhage and cardiac arrest six weeks after undergoing corrective heart surgery. Sean's parents held doctors and nursing staff accountable for moving their son to Ward 32, a specialized children's heart unit, prematurely from intensive care. They allege that medical professionals also failed to notice obvious indications of his deteriorating condition. Ms Turner said she had "expected a more aggressive investigation". "I don't think it has gone far enough," she said. "Certainly, within Sean's own report there are areas we feel that the review has not gone far enough; they have not been brave enough to really properly investigate. "We still feel there are areas that are whitewashed over, ignored, it's disappointing. " Children's cardiac services in Bristol are back in the news - a public inquiry in 2001 found major shortcomings and while the latest report concluded there was nothing on a similar scale this time, it does say patients were at risk of harm because of poor care. This affected patients from all over the south west of England and south Wales receiving specialist care in the city. There are wider implications too. The report finds limited capacity in Bristol's paediatric intensive care unit put heavy strains on families, and there could be a similar problem at other hospitals. It calls for a national review, which NHS England has agreed to carry out. The treatment of children with congenital heart disease is highly complex and specialised and the report's authors say they hope the review helps strengthen the delivery of these services across the country. Eleanor Grey QC, who led the investigation, stated: "Certain families were provided with quality care and experienced positive results, while others did not. " She said that "a very large expert panel" looked at the findings and "it was their judgements about care which was reflected in those individual reports, which we delivered personally and confidentially to families". "We will meet with the families and discuss what is in their individual reports," she added. She said 32 recommendations had been made that "require action not just on the part of the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children but also NHS England and the Department of Health". Laurence Vick, a medical negligence solicitor who represents families of children who died or were injured, said it would be "a struggle" for parents to accept the report, which they felt was "less than critical". "Unfortunately, particularly the bereaved parents remain convinced that the failings at Bristol caused or contributed to the deaths of their children," he said. A separate Care Quality Commission review found the standard of care was comparable with other centres in the UK but recommended better communication with children and their parents before and after surgery. Robert Woolley, chief executive of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, said he "fully accepted" the findings of the two reports, and claimed some improvements had already been made. "We are deeply sorry for the things we got wrong - for when our care fell below acceptable standards, for not supporting some families as well as we could have and for not always learning adequately from our mistakes," he said. "We didn't get it right for these families, and I'd like to apologise to the families unreservedly. " About 10 families from across England and Wales are believed to be taking legal action against the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, including seven whose children were treated on Ward 32.
Mark Jones, 43, passed away on Saturday after being hospitalized since the incident on 26 July. Two suspects are charged with attempted murder and possessing a shotgun following the occurrence on New Road, Mountain Ash. South Wales Police has stated that a reassessment of these charges will be conducted. Edward Bennett, aged 47, from Mountain Ash, and Stephen Bennett, aged 52, from Pontypridd, were both kept in custody following their court appearance at Cardiff Crown Court in August. Detective Chief Inspector Ceri Hughes said: "Mark's family is in our minds and they are getting assistance from a family liaison officer during this difficult time." A assessment of allegations regarding the two individuals who are currently detained will be carried out.
A UK and Finnish team found those with more education were as likely to show the signs of dementia in their brains at death as those with less. But they were less likely to have displayed symptoms during their lifetime, the study in Brain said. Experts said scientists now had to find out why the effect occurred. Over the past decade, studies on dementia have consistently shown that the more time you spend in education, the lower the risk of dementia. But studies have been unable to show whether or not education - which is linked to higher socio-economic status and healthier lifestyles - protects the brain against dementia. The researchers in this study examined the brains of 872 people who had been part of three large ageing studies. Before their deaths they had also completed questionnaires about their education. The researchers found that more education makes people better able to cope with changes in the brain associated with dementia. Post-mortems showed the pathology - signs of disease - in the brains of people with and without long educations were at similar levels. But the researchers found those with more education are better able to compensate for the effects of the condition. It also showed that, for each year spent in education, there was an 11% decreased risk of developing dementia. Dr Hannah Keage, who worked on the study at the University of Cambridge, stated that past studies have revealed that there is not a direct correlation between being diagnosed with dementia during life and the brain changes observed at death. "One individual may exhibit significant brain pathology while another may show minimal pathology, yet both could have had dementia." "Our study shows education in early life appears to enable some people to cope with a lot of changes in their brain before showing dementia symptoms. " The researchers used data from the Eclipse collaboration, which combines the three European population-based longitudinal studies of ageing from the UK and Finland which have assessed people for up to 20 years. Professor Carol Brayne, who conducted the research, stated: "Education is recognized as beneficial for overall public health and fairness. This research reinforces the importance of investing in factors during early life that can positively influence society and individuals throughout their lifespan. " "This is hugely relevant to policy decisions about the importance of resource allocation between health and education. " Ruth Sutherland, chief executive  of the Alzheimer's Society, said: "This is the largest study ever to confirm that hitting the books could help you fight the symptoms of dementia in later life. We lack understanding of why extended education is beneficial. "Perhaps individuals who pursue longer studies possess larger brains that are more adept at adapting to dementia-related changes. " "Another reason could be that educated people find ways of managing or hiding their symptoms. " She added: "We now need more research to find out why an education can make the brain more 'dementia resistant'. Until then the message appears to be stay in school. " Rebecca Wood, chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, added: "During dementia, proteins build up in the brain and nerve cells become damaged. This research suggests that education is not able to stop the damage but enables the brain to cope better and alleviate its impact. ".
Initial official claims that the bomber was a lone woman have been replaced by uncertainty about who carried it out. President Vladimir Putin has ordered security to be tightened at railway stations and airports across Russia. Moscow is concerned militant groups could be ramping up violence in the run-up to the 2014 winter Olympic Games in the city of Sochi in six weeks. The Olympic venue is close to Russia's volatile north Caucasus region. By Daniel SandfordBBC News, Moscow In June, Doku Umarov, one of the leaders of the Islamist insurgency in the Russian Caucasus republics, called on his supporters to use "maximum force" to disrupt the "satanic" winter Olympics in Sochi. It is too early to say whether the attack in Volgograd was by one of his supporters. But it shows that - despite the metal detectors at railway stations, airports and shopping centres in Russia - bombers are still able to kill and wreak havoc. It also shows that the attacks will not have to be on Sochi itself to attract attention. Sunday's explosion rocked Volgograd-1 station at around 12:45 (08:45 GMT) at a time of year when millions of Russians are travelling to celebrate the New Year. A nearby security camera facing the station caught the moment of the blast, showing a bright orange flash behind the station's main doors. The explosion shattered windows and sent debris and plumes of smoke from the station entrance. The first cameras on the scene showed bodies lying outside, and inside, twisted metal and singed, pock-marked walls. Motionless bodies were laid out in the station forecourt while ambulances rushed those hurt to hospital. About 40 people are said to have been injured, including a nine-year-old girl whose mother was killed in the attack. "People were lying on the ground, screaming and calling for help," a witness, Alexander Koblyakov, told Rossiya-24 TV. "I helped carry out a police officer whose head and face were covered in blood. He couldn't speak. " President Putin ordered law enforcement agencies to take "all necessary security measures" in the bomb's aftermath, said a Kremlin spokesman. He ordered the most gravely injured victims to be flown to Moscow for treatment. Security will be stepped up at railway stations and airports. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the blast, but a spokesman for Russia's Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, said the incident was being treated as an act of terrorism. An Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region has led to many attacks there in recent years. Insurgents have also attacked big Russian towns. This attack shows that the bombers do not need to attack Sochi directly to attract international attention - any target in Russia will do, says the BBC's Daniel Sandford in Moscow. Volgograd lies about 900km (560 miles) south of Moscow, 650km north of the North Caucasus and 700km north-east of Sochi. The bomb used in the attack contained 10 kg (22 pounds) of TNT, was rigged with shrapnel and was detonated near the metal detectors at the station entrance, Mr Markin said. He said that initial information suggested the bomber "approached a metal detector, saw a policeman there, got nervous and detonated the bomb stuffed with pieces of shrapnel". He stated that the security presence had averted a higher number of casualties at the station, which was crowded at the time of the explosion due to several delayed trains. Mr Markin was one of the officials indicating early on that the attacker was a woman - with RIA Novosti news agency identifying the bomber as a Dagestani woman named Oksana Aslanova, and other media outlets releasing photos of what they claimed was the decapitated head of the female bomber. But investigators' initial certainty was replaced with uncertainty, with suggestions the bomber could have been a man or that there could have been multiple bombers, our correspondent says. In July, Chechen insurgent leader Doku Umarov posted an online video urging militants to use "maximum force" to prevent the Games from going ahead. A suspected female suicide bomber killed at least six people when she attacked a bus in Volgograd in October. On Friday, a car bomb killed three people in the southern Russian city of Pyatigorsk.
Amanda McCabe followed Claire Smith around Dundee before boxing her in her vehicle in a car park and punching her. McCabe claimed she had been travelling to a specialist wool shop in Dundee and had followed Ms Smith coincidentally. Sheriff John Rafferty told her to bring "several knitted items" to court on her sentencing date to prove her skills. Her lawyer promised to take them to a charity shop "to help the needy". The court heard that Ms Smith and a friend were driving on Dundee's Kingsway when MCabe entered from a slip road. Depute prosecutor John Adams stated: "Ms Smith was not particularly pleased with the defendant's driving and expressed her displeasure." Ms Smith was followed by McCabe, before pulling into a car park to make a u-turn. McCabe boxed in Ms Smith's car before opening her door and punching her on the face. McCabe, 47, of Dundee, admitted assaulting Ms Smith on 8 January. Solicitor advocate Jim Laverty, defending, said: "Your lordship chose a unique approach to this from the sewing box. "As a result she was the target of abuse on social media, where everyone can have an opinion and express it in writing. "She was made out to be some kind of Madame Defarge character from A Tale of Two Cities. " Sheriff John Rafferty told McCabe at an earlier hearing: "If you are a skilled knitter then I am sure that you could produce some goods for charity. "You will bring to court several items that you have knitted that you are prepared to donate to a charity shop. He warned McCabe during the most recent hearing, stating, "I provided you with a chance to compensate society, and you did so without any cost to taxpayers. ".
Numbers of Arctic char have plummeted at Ennerdale in the Lake District because of acidity in the water caused by the surrounding coniferous woodland. The trees are being moved back from the lake, but in the meantime Kielder Water in Northumberland has become an "ark". The Environment Agency is releasing 10,000 young fish into the reservoir. The juvenile fish, which are two inches long, have been reared at the agency's Kielder hatchery. Hatchery manager Richard Bond said: "These fish are unique. There are approximately 20 populations of Arctic char in the nation, and over time they have each adjusted to their specific habitats as they do not migrate back to the ocean and interbreed with other populations. "Arctic char are fond of cold water and deep lakes, making Kielder Water an ideal environment for these fish. " "We hope that the stocked fish will grow and ultimately breed in the streams that enter Kielder reservoir, preserving and protecting this rare strain. " Ennerdale has been stocked by fish reared at the Kielder hatchery since 2006. But this is the first time they have been released into Kielder Water. Don Coe, fisheries manager for Northumbrian Water, which owns Kielder Water, said: "The vast expanse of Kielder Water, which holds 200,000 million litres of water, should prove to be a great safe haven for these fish. However, with depths reaching 170 feet and covering 2,740 acres, it could be quite a while before any indications of the stocking's success become apparent. The Arctic char is a member of the salmon and trout family.
The Hashid Shaabi groups claim they want to remove IS from Tal Afar, disrupting jihadist supply lines from Syria to Mosul. Tal Afar had a notable Shia community prior to being seized by IS in 2014. Mosul is predominantly Sunni, and the Shia militias have promised not to enter the city. Iraq initiated the attack last week. Iraqi, Kurdish and allied troops, supported by US air support, have made progress in their effort to recapture Mosul, the de facto capital of IS in Iraq. "The operation aims to cut supplies between Mosul and Raqqa (IS's de facto capital in Syria) and tighten the siege. in Mosul and liberate Tal Afar," Hashid Shaabi spokesman Ahmed al-Assadi told the AFP news agency. He added that the operation was launched from an area south of Mosul. During previous military campaigns against IS, Shia militia groups have been accused of committing serious crimes, including war crimes, against Sunni civilians. As many as 1. 5 million people are believed to remain in Mosul. There are fears IS could use them as human shields as the operation closes in on the city. On Friday, the UN said that IS militants had abducted tens of thousands of civilians from areas around the city to use them as human shields. The jihadist group has also killed some 190 former members of Iraq's security services and 42 civilians, apparently for refusing to obey its orders, the UN added.
Asos reported pre-tax profits of £18m for the six months to 28 February, down from £20. 1m a year earlier. However, the firm said it was confident of hitting its full-year profit target Retail sales grew 17%, after currency fluctuations were removed, to £536m. Asos also said that sales in the UK were up 27%. The firm said international sales were gaining momentum following the introduction of zonal pricing, allowing the company to price its products more competitively in different regions. That helped boost overseas sales by 10% but reduced its profit margin. Analysts currently expect Asos to report a full-year pre-tax profit of about £45m. Asos is still recovering from a tumultuous 2014 which saw a warehouse fire at one of its largest distribution centres force it to suspend trading. The combination of the strong pound and a large investment programme aimed at increasing its warehouse space have also hurt profit. Chief executive Nick Robertson, stated: "As we maintain our focus on enhancing our global pricing competitiveness, we are seeing positive momentum in the company. This reinforces our confidence in the projections for the upcoming months." "Active customers have grown by 13% over the last year, with traffic from mobile devices now representing over 50% of all website traffic. ".
The 90-year-old previously won an Oscar for Lawrence of Arabia in 1963. She was hailed as "a trailblazer" by Nicole Kidman at the Governors Awards, the Academy's dedicated ceremony for honorary awards. Her career has spanned the 1952 adaptation of Charles Dickens' The Pickwick Papers and last year's Fifty Shades of Grey. Accepting the award, Coates said: "Can you imagine a job where you're actually paid to look into the eyes of George Clooney, Peter O'Toole, Richard Burton, Peter Finch, Sean Connery, Albert Finney, Clint Eastwood, Richard Gere, Daniel Craig, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Fifty Shades Of Grey himself Jamie Dornan?" Stars paid tribute to Coates at the ceremony, including Richard Gere, who appeared in the 2002 film Unfaithful, which she edited. He hailed her as "one of the great giants of our industry" and "the greatest of the great, great, great film editors". Kidman, the Australian actress, expressed that Anne V. Coates is not just a great female editor, but a great editor overall. She's not trailblazer for women, she's a trailblazer for all of us. "Anne has left her mark on some of the greatest films of all time. Born in 1925 in Reigate, Surrey, Coates has continued to be involved in her work until recently, when she was involved in editing the film adaptation of EL James's popular book, Fifty Shades of Grey. In a recent interview with the LA Times, she discussed her efforts to incorporate more sensuality into the movie. "They were worried they wouldn't get the R rating. I would have had her trussed up like a suitcase and hoisted to the ceiling," she said. Also honoured at the ceremony on Saturday night were the documentary film maker Frederick Wiseman, casting director Lynn Stalmaster and the martial arts star Jackie Chan. Chan made his film debut at the age of eight, before starring in more than 30 films in Hong Kong. He achieved worldwide fame after Rumble in the Bronx in 1995, going on to star in Hollywood films including the Rush Hour trilogy, Shanghai Noon and The Karate Kid in 2010. "It's a dream," Chan said on stage. "Friends, fans around the world, because of you I have a reason to continue making movies, jumping out windows, kicking and punching and breaking my bones. " The Governors Awards, which were attended by stars such as Sylvester Stallone, Don Cheadle and Helen Mirren, were launched in 2009 to provide more time to celebrate honorary awards than the televised Oscar ceremony in February allows. They are intended to recognise lifetime achievement, exceptional contributions to cinema and outstanding service to the Academy.
But on Sunday he sent his shootout penalty high into the New Jersey sky and Chile went on to win the Copa America title - after which Messi announced his international retirement. The emotion of the moment may have played a part, but there is additional significance beyond just the pain of defeat. Last week Messi voiced his discontent with the Argentine FA (AFA), calling the governing body a "disaster" after the team's travel plans were delayed. There have also been issues with hotel rooms not being ready for the players and poor facilities. He said he would refrain from sharing his thoughts on the matter until after the final, amidst turmoil at the AFA following the passing of Julio Grondona, who had served as chairman for 35 years until 2014. So it could well be that even in the cold light of day the 29-year-old will stand his ground. If so, if he never plays another game for Argentina, how will his career be remembered in the years to come? The line that Messi never reproduces his club form for his country now seems a little spurious. Even in this tournament he has done some remarkable things. Against Panama in the group stage he came off the bench and turned a narrow 1-0 win into a 5-0 romp, scoring three and setting up another, making football look ridiculously easy. In the quarter-final he quickly undressed a Venezuela defence that had only conceded one goal in its three group games, and he touched the heights in the semi-final against the USA, especially with that sublime free-kick. He had his moments in the final - Chile were soon down to 10 men after holding midfielder Marcelo Diaz picked up two yellow cards, both for stopping Messi in full flight. But always, and especially in South America, titles are what counts. Losing a final can be considered even worse than going out in the group stages; the comedown is greater because the dreams have grown bigger. And now, for the fourth time with Argentina and for the third year in a row, Messi has been on the losing side in a final. He had just turned 20 for the first, a 3-0 defeat by Brazil in the final of the 2007 Copa. But in the last three has been the captain, the leader, the best player in the world, the man expected to make a difference. All three have been narrow defeats - a single goal to Germany in the 2014 World Cup final, and on penalties to Chile in the Copa in 2015 and now this year as well. All three have gone to extra time. And yet in six hours of football, an Argentina side known for their attacking brilliance have failed to score a single goal. Messi inevitably carries the can for this. Before Sunday's match Argentina football legend Diego Maradona said that the team should not bother coming home if they lose. Year in, year out, Messi has been more consistent at the highest level than Maradona was. But Maradona starts off with a head start over Messi - he grew up among the Argentines, whereas Messi, who moved from his hometown of Rosario to Spain at the age of 13, is often accused of being a Catalan, especially when things go wrong. Plus, Maradona has that title. He was the leader of the pack when Argentina won the World Cup in 1986. His form in the quarters and the semi-finals, against England and Belgium, was out of this world. In the final against Germany he was marked by the mighty Lothar Matthaus, and had to play a more collective role. The Germans had hit back to 2-2, and appeared to have the momentum on their side - but Maradona produced a gorgeous through-ball, and Jorge Burruchaga raced away to slip past the keeper and win the game. In this respect, perhaps, Maradona was luckier with his team-mates. If Burruchaga had missed, and the Germans had gone on to win the game, then maybe the star of Maradona would not shine quite so brightly in Argentina. But where Maradona had Burruchaga, Messi has Gonzalo Higuain. A highly proficient marksman, Higuain has nevertheless been the villain of the piece in all three of the recent Argentine finals, squandering opportunities that he should have gobbled up. This time it happened in the first half, when he robbed Gary Medel and bore down on goal. It was the clearest chance of the game, and Higuain rolled it wide. A sense of 'here we go again' descended on the Argentina players. Perhaps Maradona would have fought that feeling with more fury, inspiring those around him to make their own destiny. But had Higuain taken his chances, then Messi would now be swimming in international titles, and no-one would dare to doubt his place among the greatest of all time.
The Secretary of State for Scotland faced protests at the event in Dumfries the week before. Mr. Arkless has expressed worries to the Speaker and Cabinet Office about the conduct of the Conservative Member of Parliament for the neighboring district. However, a spokesman for Mr Mundell said he had complied with rules and notified him of the engagement. Mr Arkless said he believed the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale may have broken the ministerial code in relation to accepted behaviour of MPs. He said House of Commons speakers had repeatedly instructed that MPs intending to perform a public engagement in another member's constituency should inform them and "proper notice" should be given. He said the only notification he had received was a "panicky" email one hour before the event. He claimed it was a "clear breach" of House of Commons rules and potentially the ministerial code. A spokesperson for Mr Mundell affirmed that he had abided by the regulations. "David went to a communal facility that caters to both areas in his capacity as a constituency MP," he said. "He fully complied with the House of Commons rules by formally notifying neighbouring MP Richard Arkless of the engagement in his constituency. "If Mr Arkless is claiming he still wasn't aware, he must have been the only person in Scotland who didn't know David was attending the event. ".
A report from the Health Foundation and the King's Fund sets out a "transformation fund" that will need at least £1. 5bn a year on top of £8bn the government has promised by 2020. The report states that the fund would enable investment in innovative forms of healthcare. The Department of Health confirmed that the government was allocating the extra funds requested by the NHS. It said efficiency savings and cost control measures had to be delivered by the service. The report also said that front line staff need time away from their usual jobs for training. Anita Charlesworth, chief economist at the Health Foundation, said: "While we recognise that it is challenging to provide additional funding for the NHS in the context of other services receiving cuts, the alternative is to risk a decline in quality and safety in NHS-funded care and a reduction to the services currently available. "Without more resources specifically for transformation, the NHS will be unable to become more productive and the bill for additional running costs will only get larger. " She added: "The transformation fund should become a fundamental part of the DNA of the health service from here onwards. " Richard Murray, director of policy at the King's Fund, said dedicated funding was needed to deliver changes. The Institute for Public Policy Research has also released a report calling for a "transformation fund" that is independently administered by a board of politically neutral health experts. It comes after Chancellor George Osborne told unprotected government departments they must find savings. His spending review is calling for £20bn cuts to Whitehall budgets, although the NHS budget will be protected.
He was most famous for his role in the initial theatrical performance of Hairspray and also made appearances in TV shows like The Sopranos and Law & Order. Marc Shaiman, the composer and lyricist for Hairspray, verified the information in a Facebook post. "Hairspray (and Broadway) has lost a huge piece of its heart. RIP to the glorious, loving and much loved Dick Latessa," he wrote. "This was a man who defined Pro, with the timing of a Swiss watch and a voice, a smile and sweet soul that made you feel special just to know him. We were lucky to have him in our lives, he was, truly, timeless. " Latessa played the role of Wilbur Turnblad in the original 2002 production of Hairspray, an adaption of the 1988 film. He went on to win the Tony Award for best featured actor in a musical the following year. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

A large mob attacked union stewards with machetes and sharp objects at the Anglo American Platinum mine. Security guards fired rubber bullets at the mob, injuring nine miners. Four guards were also wounded in the fight. Last August, Rustenburg was the scene of violent wildcat strikes, during which police shot dead 34 miners. The bloodshed at the Marikana mine was the most deadly police action since South Africa became a democracy in 1994 and sparked national outrage. No officers were involved in Monday's incident, police spokesman Thulani Ngubane confirmed to the BBC. The stand-off is thought to have taken place between the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) - allied to the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party - and the militant Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu). The dispute may have been regarding the use of union offices at the Anglo American Platinum's Siphumelele mine shaft in Rustenburg, located 100km (60 miles) north-west of Johannesburg, according to Mr Ngubane. He added that mine security intervened and employed rubber bullets, leading to injuries for 13 mine workers and four security guards. Some of those injured were attacked with machetes and sharp objects. Three of the injured miners are thought to be in a serious condition. Last year, unauthorized strikes and disorderly protests regarding pay extended to several mines throughout South Africa, the biggest platinum producer in the world.
Fiona Parry, aged 40, was flown to Stoke-on-Trent hospital where she is in a critical condition in a coma. Sylvan Parry, 46, has been remanded in custody after appearing in court at Caernarfon Magistrates' Court and is set to face trial at the town's crown court on 14 September. The incident took place at approximately 09:00 BST on Thursday. No bail request was made during the 11-minute hearing.
Researchers have found that two diseases harboured by honeybees are spilling over into wild bumblebees. Insects infected with deformed wing virus and a fungal parasite called Nosema ceranae were found across England, Scotland and Wales. Writing in the journal Nature, the team says that beekeepers should keep their honeybees as free from disease as possible to stop the spread. "These pathogens are capable of infecting adult bumblebees and they seem to have quite significant impacts," said Professor Mark Brown from Royal Holloway, University of London. Around the world, bumblebees are doing badly. In the last few decades, many species have suffered steep declines, and some, such Cullem's bumblebee (Bombus cullumanus) in the UK, have gone extinct. Scientists believe that the destruction of their habitats - particularly wildflower meadows - has driven much of this loss, but the latest research suggests that disease too could play a role. The researchers looked at two pathogens commonly found in honeybees and found they can also infect adult bumblebees. In honeybees, deformed wing virus (DWV) causes significant problems. Its severity seems to be exacerbated by the presence of another widespread parasite, the varroa mite, causing entire colonies to collapse. Bumblebees do not carry the varroa mite, but the scientists found that those infected with DWV had a dramatically shortened lifespan. The fungal parasite has also been shown to have an impact on bumblebee longevity. Prof Brown said: "A significantly shorter lifespan in the field would impact on their ability to go out and collect food and look after other bees. The diseases were discovered to be common in wild populations, with approximately 11% of bumblebees infected with DWV and 7% infected with the fungus across 26 sites in Great Britain and the Isle of Man. By comparison, about 35% of honeybees carried DWV and 9% had the fungus. "A geographical patterning provides us with the information that transmission is occurring among these animals - they are sharing parasite strains," said Prof Brown. "We cannot say it definitively, but because of the epidemiology, the most likely explanation is that the honeybees are acting as the source of the virus for the bumblebees. The team believes that a similar trend will be observed globally and emphasizes the importance of managing disease in honeybee colonies to prevent further transmission. "It is crucial that we implement policies at both national and international levels to help beekeepers maintain healthy colonies," Prof Brown stated. "The benefits are not just to the honeybees, they are to the wild bees as well. " Dr David Aston, president of the British Beekeepers Association (BBKA), said: "By employing good husbandry practices, beekeepers can take steps to reduce the impact of pests and diseases on honeybee colonies using biotechnical controls and practices such as apiary hygiene, regular brood comb changes, ensuring the colonies are strong and well-nourished and the use of authorised treatments. " But he added: "Beekeepers need new effective medications and other biotechnical controls to help in the management of bee pests and diseases and these should be a high-priority action. " The researchers also want to investigate whether neonicotinoid pesticides are playing a role in problem. A recent paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal suggested that the chemicals are affecting the immune systems of honeybees, making them more susceptible to pathogens. "If bumblebees were exposed to neonicotinoids and had the same effect, you would expect the bumblebee viral load to be going through the roof. This is something we are hoping to test later," said Prof Brown. In the European Union, neonicotinoids have been banned for two years because of fears that they may be harmful to bees. But the British government strongly opposed the plan, rejecting the science behind the moratorium. Both Syngenta and Bayer, which manufacture neonicotinoids, are now taking legal action against the European Commission in an effort to overturn the ban. Follow Rebecca on Twitter.
The event was organised by trade unionists, councillors, Labour Party members, and MSPs. They are calling for action by the Scottish and UK governments to protect the industry and its jobs. About 400 marchers set off at 11:00 from the Dalzell works, heading to Ravenscraig for a rally. Tata Steel has revealed intentions to close the factories, potentially resulting in the loss of up to 270 jobs. Additionally, 900 positions at the Scunthorpe facility are also at risk. The Dalzell plate-rolling works in Motherwell may face a reduction of 225 positions, while the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang could experience a loss of 45 jobs. The company attributes a decline in steel prices to inexpensive imports from China and high energy expenses. The Scottish government has assembled a taskforce to try to guarantee a future for the plants. Community union representative Derek Fearon said: "We are trying to raise awareness of the campaign, and hopefully through this Tata will become a responsible seller. "The main aim of the taskforce, the priority of it, is for the two plants to remain open. "The mood is upbeat, the guys are still positive that everything can be done for the two plants to be saved. " The Scottish government has pledged to do everything possible to keep the plants operational, with its preferred option being to find a buyer. However, ministers have not ruled out moves to bring both facilities under public ownership. A Scottish Steel Task Force, chaired by business minister Fergus Ewing, and including representatives from trade unions and Tata, as well as local councils, met last week to discuss the way forward. Motherwell and Wishaw MSP John Pentland, himself a former steelworker, has welcomed the creation of the task force and called for all avenues to be explored to keep the plants open. He said: "The starting point for the Scottish Task Force should be saving the steel plants and all the jobs, not softening the blow. "We should not meekly accept the annihilation of the Scottish steel industry. We are not interested in receiving inadequate solutions like retraining for nonexistent positions. There are alternative measures available to safeguard the industry and its workforce. "I believe Scottish steel can have a future, and we must consider all the options to achieve that, including public ownership, which doesn't rely on Westminster anymore. ".
Alt-pop artist FKA Twigs won best single (Pendulum) and best album (LP1), both of which she co-produced. Catherine Marks was named breakthrough producer of the year for her work on Wolf Alice's Mercury-nominated album My Love Is Cool. Sylvia Massy, known for her work with REM and Prince, was presented with an award for her inspirational achievements. The American producer, with a collection of 25 gold and platinum albums, was recognized for her dedication to safeguarding and advocating for classic recording gear, as well as her contributions as a writer, artist, and educator. Figures gathered in 2010 indicated that fewer than 5% of record producers were women, although the number is believed to have increased with advancements in technology allowing for music production in home studios or on laptops. "The diversity of talent recognized at MPG Awards this year is truly remarkable and we are pleased to be showcasing the growing presence of women in the top echelons of music production," stated MPG award director Tony Platt. Elsewhere, the awards honoured Swedish pop svengali Max Martin, whose recent hits include Ellie Goulding's Love Me Like You Do, The Weeknd's Can't Feel My Face and large swathes of Taylor Swift's global smash album 1989. He was named best international producer, while Olga Fitzroy, who works closely with Coldplay, was named recording engineer of the year. Charlie Andrew won the top honour  - producer of the year -  recognising his contribution to albums by Alt-J, Sivu and Marika Hackman in 2015. The award means he automatically received the 2016 Brit Award for best producer, which was presented at the same time. The lifetime achievement prize went to Youth, who sat behind the mixing desk on classic albums like The Verve's Urban Hymns, James's Seven and Together Alone by Crowded House. The artist, known as Martin Glover, also plays bass in Killing Joke and has collaborated on three experimental electronic albums with Sir Paul McCartney as The Fireman. He received his award from Richard Ashcroft of The Verve, and later performed Bittersweet Symphony with David Gilmour, Jah Wobble, and Sex Pistols drummer Mark Cook. Finally, Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick won the MPG Award for innovation.
Only two Scots - Stuart Hogg and Tommy Seymour - were selected in Warren Gatland's 41-man squad for the summer trip to New Zealand. Glasgow boss Gregor Townsend and Scotland attack coach Jason O'Halloran both turned down Lions roles. "Because there was no Scottish voice, I think they lost out," O'Driscoll said. "You have to have someone pushing your name forward in those very, very tight selections. There was no Scottish coach in the selection meetings batting for any Scotland players. " Head coach Gatland, who is on a break from leading Wales to take charge of the Lions, included 12 members of the Welsh squad that finished fifth in this year's Six Nations and were beaten by Scotland at Murrayfield. O'Driscoll, who earned a place on four successive Lions tours - but was unexpectedly dropped by Gatland for the decisive third Test against Australia in 2013 - is not surprised the New Zealander has trusted those he knows. "I'm not shocked at that at all," the former Ireland centre told BBC Sport. We have seen it on an international scale. We observed this in Ireland during the beginning of Joe Schmidt's time as Ireland coach. "He consistently turned to the Leinster players he was familiar with, who he knew well and understood their personalities, in making 50-50 decisions because they had previously delivered for him. " Gatland has insisted player nationalities did not influence the selection of the squad, which also features 16 England players and 11 from the Ireland squad. "I didn't realise the split in the numbers," he said this week. "We put together a group of players in each position we felt were in contention and then we went through and individually selected those players. " O'Driscoll, 38, captained the Lions on their last visit to New Zealand in 2005, but his involvement in the tour was curtailed by injury less than two minutes into the first Test. He warns facing the back-to-back world champions on their own patch is the toughest task in rugby, but believes the Lions can upset the odds. "They need their best players out on the park, they need to make sure they don't have a big injury toll to some of their key players," he added. "It's not a three-Test tour down there, it's like playing 10 Test matches against New Zealand opposition. They're fighting for their lives, they're fighting for history, to be remembered as the side that beat the Lions. "It's the most difficult place to go and play, and that's before you come up against the mighty All Blacks, so you need a lot of things to go your way. You need a little bit of luck, you need a very good gameplan, and you need everyone playing on form, and then you've got a chance, such is the difficulty of playing down there. "I definitely think they can win a Test match, and if they can win one, they can squeeze a second one. There's no doubt the All Blacks are strong favourites to win the series, but you don't think it's a foregone conclusion. ".
The immediate constitutional goal is now for Scotland to gain control of all taxation, including North Sea revenues, loosening the ties that bind the United Kingdom together. The SNP manifesto ditches the dismal name for this policy of "full fiscal autonomy" in favour of "full fiscal responsibility" and "full financial responsibility. " Better? You can decide. Whatever it is called, the precise meaning is disputed but it is usually taken to describe Scotland having control of all taxation raised north of the border, including revenue from oil in its territorial waters. The country would remain in the United Kingdom in something akin to a federal arrangement, paying the Treasury in London for shared services, such as defence and foreign affairs. There are some big problems with FFA just now, and they are set out in the arid tables, charts and graphs of Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland 2013/14. According to GERS, Scotland was £12. 4bn in the red in 2013/14, raising £10,100 per person but spending £12,500 each. Of course the UK is also in the red but Scotland's situation is comparatively worse. Measured relative to the size of the economy, Scotland had a significantly greater deficit than the UK average in 2013/14 at 8. 1% of GDP compared to 5. 6% for the entire UK. Many economists believe that this is far from being sustainable. And critics argue that it is not even unusual in recent times. Scotland has been said to have spent more and raised less than the UK average in 12 out of the last 15 financial years, including oil revenue. The situation has been deteriorating due to a decline in oil production and a decrease in oil prices. The SNP say a "fully fiscally responsible" Scotland could do better. It could tailor economic policy to the country's needs, balance the books and perhaps eventually put the profits from oil aside in the good years to help the country through tougher times. Supporters have set out the case that the country would be much better off independent. Whether or not that long term vision is realistic, for now it looks tricky. On the latest available figures, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates that it would leave Scotland with a £7. 6bn shortfall - on top of the country's current share of the UK deficit. This prediction has been seized on by the SNP's opponents who have accused the nationalists of refusing to accept defeat in last year's independence referendum and being hell-bent on bankrupting the country by other means. The SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon understands these difficulties. During a televised debate earlier this month she confirmed her MPs would vote for full fiscal autonomy if they could next year but she has since deployed phrases like "in years ahead" and "in several years" when asked when it might happen. And today, the manifesto has little to say on the detail and the timetable, other than the "transition to full fiscal responsibility - and agreement of the detailed fiscal framework that would underpin it - would take a number of years. " The SNP does not want this debate to become the central theme of this general election campaign. Their opponents have precisely the opposite intention.
The scheme will also include a bypass around Dungiven. The confirmation follows a lengthy public inquiry which has now concluded. Northern Ireland's transport minister Michelle McIlveen said that up to £400m will be spent on the 18 mile stretch between Derry and Dungiven. It is expected to be allocated during the budget period up to 2021. There is no indication as to when the work will begin. Ms McIlveen said on Wednesday that the announcement is good news for the north-west. "The A6 is a key transport route and the construction of a new dual carriageway will help to reduce journey times and improve road safety," she said. "There is no doubt that this scheme represents a significant investment in our economy and will create hundreds of jobs. " Sinn Féin MLA Cathal Ó hOisín said the announcement was a tremendous boost for the entire region. "The campaign to have the A6 transformed into a dual carriageway and the creation of a bypass at Dungiven has taken many years but we are now seeing light at the end of the tunnel. "It will play a significant role in enhancing the economic prosperity of the area and the bypass of Dungiven will have a significant environmental effect on the town."
The former first minister is to star in Alex Salmond Unleashed at the annual arts festival in August. All 15 performances have now sold out - with Mr Salmond selling a total of 5,250 tickets at the 350-capacity Assembly Rooms. The show is described as a "festival of fun, friends and freedom", and a chance to find out what he "really thinks". The 62-year-old former SNP leader will be joined on stage with a different celebrity guest each night, with the promise of "light-hearted banter and a few behind the scenes revelations about his time in power". Tickets had been on sale at Â£22. 50 each, or Â£17. 50 for concessions. Speaking as he announced the show earlier this month, Mr Salmond said: "I have always fancied a spot at the Edinburgh Fringe and this is going to be lots of fun. "Obviously in the show there will be lots about politics but the emphasis will be very much on the lighter side. "Among the invited guests there is already plenty of excitement and quite a few surprises. I suspect some people might be taken aback at the range of friends whom I invite along. Mr Salmond was defeated in the general election in June and it has been said that Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, a former SNP MP who also lost her seat in the election, will be one of the producers for his show. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's appearance at the fringe has also sold out. Mr Corbyn will be appearing at the New Town Theatre on 27 August, when he will speak to comedian and broadcaster Susan Morrison about "what makes him tick, how he deals with adversity, and why our country, and its politics, needs to be transformed".
Lord Hall was appearing before an assembly committee inquiry into the review of the BBC's Charter. He said a long-term decline in English-language programmes by BBC Wales was the result of challenging financial settlements, not management failure. Lord Hall stated that there was an ongoing assessment of the depiction of various communities on national UK programming. He also commended the achievements of the BBC's drama studios located in Cardiff Bay. Asked how the BBC would address issues about the portrayal of Wales, Lord Hall said he was interested in "the best way of getting the best ideas coming out of Wales" on to the network. "You're saying, 'because you're the BBC this is something that really should matter to you', and it does. "I want us to get this right, but also I'm grateful for the appreciation that we've done an awful lot in spend terms, and people terms. I believe this is the main concern for us now. Lord Hall has expressed his goal of implementing a unified BBC "service licence" for Wales, which would replace the current licences overseeing individual radio, TV, and online platforms. AMs asked whether the cut to S4C's budget as part of the UK government's spending review would affect the relationship between the broadcasters. S4C receives 90% of its funding (around Â£75m) from the BBC, with around 8% (Â£6. 7m) from the UK government. Rhodri Talfan Davies, director of BBC Cymru Wales, informed the committee that the budget of S4C was a concern for the broadcaster, the UK government, and the BBC Trust. He emphasized that the collaboration between BBC and S4C in producing programs would continue, highlighting the importance of seeking opportunities to work together whenever feasible.
The Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust (KBRT) was set up just over two years ago by the Bell family from Newry, County Down, after a personal tragedy. Colin Bell's 26-year-old son, Kevin, was killed in a suspected hit-and-run in New York in June 2013. Since then, the bereaved father has made it his life's mission to help other families, whose loved ones die in sudden or tragic circumstances abroad. It can cost several thousand pounds to repatriate bodies and, until the trust was established, families had to pay it themselves because neither the UK or Irish governments cover the expense. It can be a long and upsetting procedure, frequently made more difficult by bureaucratic hurdles and difficulties with language. Mr Bell, a former educator, currently dedicates his time to speaking with people all over the globe via phone and computer, assisting unknown individuals coping with the financial and administrative challenges that come up when a loved one passes away in a distant location. He often attends the funerals in person, and most of his weekends are taken up by fundraising events across Ireland. When I call to interview him, I interrupt him at an undertakers' conference in Dublin, where he is promoting the work of the trust. Colin's son had been a popular member of his local Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club and in the aftermath of Kevin's death, friends and supporters in Newry raised about Â£150,000 towards the cost of his repatriation from the USA. However, after Kevin's American employers agreed to pay to transport his body home, the Bells had to make a decision about what to do with the funds raised on their behalf. "We had this huge amount of money, and we decided that we would use it - in Kevin's name - to help other families who were visited with the same tragedy," Colin said. To date, they have arranged repatriations to almost every county in Ireland. The grim milestone of 100 was reached last week, but for Mr Bell, the statistic is proof that something positive has come out of his personal loss. "We decided, when we were setting this up, this was going to be Kevin's legacy, that some good would come out of his death and that helps us, knowing that we are helping other people. " Michael Douglas, from the Greater Shankill area of Belfast, was among those who needed emergency financial assistance from the trust when his 30-year-old sister Heather died suddenly in the USA. "The American undertakers wouldn't release the body to the airport until payment was made," Mr Douglas said. Faced with an immediate bill of about Â£7,000 and a "race against time" to meet the flight booked to take Heather's body back home, Mr Douglas made contact with Mr Bell. "That was literally the first conversation I had with him. I said 'look, sorry, but I have to phone you and ask you to pay this'. He said 'No problem, just email me all the stuff and leave it with me and I'll sort it out'," Mr Douglas recalled. "Obviously, we're a working-class family, we probably could have got that money but it would have taken us a while to put it all together. "So, to phone Colin Bell - never having spoken to him before - literally a phone call and he sorted it. It took a lot of pressure off me. " Karen Wallace, from Mullingar, County Westmeath, had not heard of the trust until her 24-year-old brother, Brendan Devenney, died suddenly while travelling around Asia in December 2014. His body was found his hotel room in India, just hours after he arrived in the country, and his cause of death is still unexplained. She said the Bell family sorted the entire repatriation after just "one phone call" and managed to get his body home within a week. Mrs Wallace expressed gratitude for the assistance of the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust, stating, "I am unsure how we would have managed without them." She noted that handling the situation independently would have been significantly more time-consuming, estimating a minimum of three weeks before factoring in the holiday season. We could have been waiting until after Christmas, so we were very, very grateful obviously. "I couldn't express my admiration and gratitude enough for their actions," she stated. "I consider the hardships they endured and how they are still dealing with their own tragedy. It's incredible that they are able to help other families despite their own struggles. " " The trust is very much a family affair. Kevin Bell was one of seven children and all his siblings, including his twin brother, are involved in the charity in some way, on a voluntary basis. Asked about his plans for the future, Colin Bell vowed that the work of trust will continue. "There's is hardly a weekend that there's not some fundraiser in some part of Ireland. We're getting amazing support from the people and we're very grateful for it," he said. "Whenever I can't do it anymore, my sons and my daughters will take over and look after it. "This is for the long-term. ".
The 26-year-old signed up with the New Zealand Warriors in September after departing from the Parramatta Eels due to personal issues. The NRL held off on his registration with the Auckland team as he managed mental health challenges, a drug overdose, and a relationship breakup. The NRL is confident that the evaluation will assess his preparedness for the rigors of the sport. "Kieran will only be allowed to play again in the NRL if that assessment is positive," NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg said. The new season starts on 2 March and Warriors hope Foran, capped 20 times for New Zealand, will be available to face the Bulldogs in Dunedin on Friday, 17 March. "We have seen Kieran's progress over the last few months and we are confident he will be ready for round three," Warriors managing director Jim Doyle said.
Jack Chappell, an 18-year-old from Stockport, is alleged to have operated an online company that provided software for targeting the websites of various large companies, such as Amazon and Vodafone. The websites that Chappell is said to have targeted include the National Crime Agency, the BBC, BT, and Netflix. Chappell is due to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. Prosecutors allege the teenager supplied denial of service software, which crashes websites by flooding them with huge volumes of data, and ran an online helpdesk for would-be hackers. He was charged following an investigation led by the West Midlands Regional Cyber Crime Unit, assisted by Israeli Police, the FBI and Europol's European Cybercrime Centre. West Midlands Police said Chappell was accused of helping cyber-criminals target websites around the world, including a 2015 attack on NatWest that affected the bank's online systems. In a statement confirming the charges, the force added: "He has been charged with impairing the operation of computers under the Computer Misuse Act, plus encouraging or assisting an offence and money laundering crime proceeds together with an American national. " None of the denial of service attacks Chappell is alleged to have been behind led to the theft or loss of any customer data, police said.
Husband and wife Tony and Julie Wadsworth were found guilty by a majority verdict of encouraging six boys to take part in sexual activity between 1992 and 1996. The couple were also convicted at Warwick Crown Court of outraging public decency by having sex in woodland. The pair, of Broughton Astley, Leicestershire, had denied the charges. Following a three-week trial, Julie Wadsworth, 60, was convicted by majority 10-2 verdicts of nine indecent assaults against boys and five counts of outraging public decency. Her spouse, 69, who acted as a "look-out", was found guilty of the same charges, also by majority verdicts. Both were found not guilty of three counts of indecent assault, two of which related to a single complainant. Some victims, who were aged 11 to 15 at the time of the offences, told the court Julie Wadsworth was variously dressed in a "flasher's mac" trench coat, white high-heels, stockings, suspenders and a split-skirt. Prosecutors said the abuse took place at a number of locations, including the couple's then home in Atherstone, Warwickshire, as well as on a nearby golf course and surrounding woodland. During the trial, the Wadsworths  - who married in 1994 - told how they had outdoor "hanky panky" in order to empower Julie Wadsworth and help her with body image issues stemming from a troubled past. She admitted having sexual encounters with "young men" but repeatedly denied any of them had been under the age of consent. In court it emerged that two groups of victims contacted police after a complainant realised what had taken place in the 90s "was not right and not appropriate". In videos of police interviews played to the jury, the man claimed he had up to 15 sexual encounters as a teenager with Julie Wadsworth - around half of them before he turned 16. On one occasion, the court heard, Tony Wadsworth joined in a "threesome" with the teenager at the couple's home after he turned 16. Tony and Julie Wadsworth were a well-known double act in the Midlands, presenting together for more than two decades for BBC local radio in Leicester and in Birmingham. The couple were known for their double-entendres and "Carry On" sense of humour - and played up to it on camera and for publicity. Although little-known outside the Midlands, the case generated lurid headlines in the newspapers as details of the couple's sex lives were revealed in court. Staff who worked with them said they had absolutely no suspicions about their sexual behaviour. Another individual, who was 14 years old at the time, informed the court that he was completely convinced that a couple he witnessed engaging in sexual activity by a tree in 1992 were the Wadsworths, and claimed that she had performed a sexual act on him. One of the accusers stated during the trial that Julie Wadsworth "must have been aware" that her victims were underage due to their physical appearance. The sixth witness estimated that he was about 11 when he and older boys saw the Wadsworths having sex against a tree. He was either 12 or 13 when he and two other boys were indecently assaulted, the man recalled. Sentencing the pair, Judge Andrew Lockhart QC said the "grave" offences had caused emotional damage to all the victims. He said Julie Wadsworth, had "loved the attention and that young boys were attracted to you" and her husband had encouraged the offences. He said it would have been obvious to anyone that the victims - some of whom were riding bikes or climbing trees in parkland - were young boys. As the verdicts were returned, Julie Wadsworth repeatedly gulped and wiped away tears. Her husband showed little emotion. Mitigating for her after conviction, David Hislop QC said: "At 60 years of age, hers has been a tragic fall from grace. a period of incarceration will be made even more difficult for her, knowing the stigma attached to her convictions will carry on forever. " Tony Wadsworth's lawyer, Michelle Clarke, said the hardest thing for him would be being separated from his wife. Speaking after the case, David Rouse, a senior prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, said the couple had lived "double lives". "In their public and professional lives they were a couple who came across as caring, warm and respectable. "However, in their private lives, they preyed on young, impressionable victims for their own sexual gratification. " He thanked the victims for their courage in bringing "two sexual predators to justice". Det Sgt Rhys Bower, from Warwickshire Police, said: "These two individuals gave no thought to the impact their actions were having on the young boys they abused; they were only concerned with their own gratification. " The NSPCC said: "The Wadsworths' behaviour has been exposed for what it is - child sexual abuse. "Julie Wadsworth's fatuous claim in court that she was a victim in this case is insulting. "The true victims were young boys who were repeatedly encouraged to engage in illegal sexual activity. " A BBC spokesman said the Wadsworths were last on air in December 2015 and no longer work for the corporation.
All 26 individuals are charged with avoiding tests, but claim there was a mistake in the paperwork. This group includes Fabrizio Donato, who won the bronze medal in the triple jump at the 2012 London Olympics, and Andrew Howe, who earned a silver medal in the long jump at the 2007 World Championships. They will face trials at the Italian Olympic Committee's anti-doping court, with rulings expected next year. Five of the 26 athletes have already qualified for next year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The group of four individuals ambushed a security van with two vehicles near Lyon, using one car to block the road's exit. The thieves then loaded the powdered gold, valued at €1. 5m ($1. 6m; £1. 3m), into their getaway car, locking two security guards in the back of the van and setting fire to their other vehicle. The two guards were rescued by police after a tip-off from a witness. The thieves fled immediately, leaving the fire to spread and gut nearby vehicles before it was put out by firefighters. The robbery took place on the A6 motorway, which connects Lyon to Paris. Police said they are hunting for the perpetrators.
UTV has operated a television station in Northern Ireland since 1959 and has other television and radio operations in the UK and Republic of Ireland. UTV airs a number of the most popular shows in Northern Ireland. Former news presenter at UTV and Ulster Unionist Party leader Mike Nesbitt expressed that the company's decision had a sense of giving up. The company entered the TV market in the Republic of Ireland in January of this year, but has faced challenges in attracting viewers. UTV Ireland is projected to suffer a loss of nearly Â£12m this year. As a result, UTV has been reviewing its options and it looks as though a radical plan is taking shape. It is in talks about the sale of its television assets, most likely to ITV. If that happens, it will mean UTV will become a radio-only business. There may not be significant on-air adjustments in the local area following the potential sale of the television industry, but it would bring about uncertainties regarding the fate of UTV Ireland. According to Mr Nesbitt, the company has transitioned from prioritizing the audience to prioritizing the shareholder. He added: "Having spent so many years making UTV stand out from ITV, the news that ITV is the most likely buyer has the whiff of surrender. ".
The 82-year-old informed his audience on his RTÉ Lyric FM program on Sunday that he will not be on air next week. I have to go to hospital this week. "They think they may have discovered a bit of cancer in the prostate and they think it may have moved up into my back," he said. "I've had the most wonderful, fantastic, robust, good health all my broadcasting life. "It's my turn now. There are many people in a much worse position. Thank you for your thoughtful words," he added. Mr Byrne is a seasoned RTÉ broadcaster, having presented The Late Late Show from 1962 to 1999. He now presents Sunday with Gay Byrne on RTÉ Lyric FM. "All Gay's friends and colleagues in RTÉ wish him a speedy recovery and look forward to welcoming him back in the coming weeks," said a spokesperson for RTÉ.
It is the Argentine-born Pope's first trip to the US and, while he has attained popularity ratings there that any politician would envy, his reputation as a Pope for the poor and the vulnerable - and his stance on saving the environment - has ruffled feathers, especially among conservatives. There is also some nervousness in Washington as to what he may say to representatives of the world's richest country, and in some quarters puzzlement over the way he does not fit easily into America's "culture wars" and defies categorisation. On his three-city tour of the US (Washington, New York and Philadelphia), this Pope from the southern hemisphere will focus on immigration, visit a prison and reach out to the poor. Some liberals are disappointed that he has not done more so far to reform Catholic teaching on same-sex relationships, despite changing the tone of the Roman Catholic Church towards gay men and women, and some campaigners are likely to want to challenge that. It is not yet clear whether he will meet victims of abuse by Catholic clerics in America, where the Church has had to pay out millions in compensation for child abuse and is still facing court cases, although it is thought likely that he will. Pope Francis has also been shifting the meaning of what it is to be Catholic in the US today. Under his predecessors, Catholic identity was tied up with opposition to abortion, a conservative position on marriage and same-sex relationships, but Pope Francis is changing the emphasis from adherence to doctrine to what Catholics do to help the poor, immigrants and the dispossessed. Paul Vallely is the author of Pope Francis: Untying the Knots - titled The Struggle for the Soul of Catholicism. He said: "Francis is not a liberal" He's a very complicated character. "He's got some liberal tendencies, but he's got some conservative tendencies too. He wants to shift the focus from sex to poverty. " There will be many opportunities on this nine-day trip for Pope Francis to challenge both the faithful and the political classes in Cuba and America. He is scheduled to deliver 26 speeches - eight in Cuba and 18 in the US - and as the Vatican is well aware, he frequently goes off-script to share his pastoral insights in the relatable language of a local priest. The majority of his speeches will be in Spanish, a language in which he tends to make spontaneous remarks, rather than in his less fluent English, which he will use for his addresses at the White House and Congress and his prayer at the 9/11 memorial. He is a Pope who has spoken of the need for priests to be "shepherds, living with the smell of their sheep", something he has put into practice in his own Papacy, while his exhortations to consume less and do more for the poor have irritated some on the American right, especially his remarks that the unbridled pursuit of money is the "dung of the devil". On that, he may find an ally in the Castro family, with his first stop in Cuba likely to see a meeting with Fidel Castro in Havana, if he is well enough, as well as President Raul Castro. Although Cuba remains an avowedly agnostic state, its president got on so well with Pope Francis on his visit to the Vatican earlier this year that he emerged with a surprising statement. "If the Pope keeps going the way he's going, I'll go back to praying and go back to the Church, and I'm not joking," President Castro said after their talks. He added: "When the Pope goes to Cuba in September, I promise to go to all his masses and with satisfaction.

The 14-year-old girl was trapped up to her waist when she was rescued from the sand on Machynys beach, near Llanelli, at 19:20 BST on Saturday. Coastguards were present along with the RNLI, police, fire, and ambulance teams. Incident commander Steve Richards, of Llanelli Fire Station, has warned people to be aware of the sinking sand and high tides. "If you're heading to the beach near Llanelli, make sure to inform others about your destination and bring a cellphone with you," he advised. "The girl was fortunate to escape the fast-moving tide and get out of the sand yesterday. " ".
Pilot Philip Garvey, 56, his wife Ann, 55, their daughter Emily, 23 and son Daniel, 20 died in the crash near Churchinford, police said. The family from Woking, Surrey, had been en route to Dunkeswell Aerodrome in east Devon. Avon and Somerset Police stated that the six-seater aircraft had been retrieved from the field for additional analysis. Officers are carrying out a joint investigation with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. The family were members of St Dunstan's Catholic Church in Woking. Emily and Daniel were former pupils of St Dunstan's Primary School and the St John the Baptist School (SJB) in Woking. A statement issued by SJB stated: "The family was highly respected within the SJB community, Emily and Daniel were two of the most pleasant and kindest young individuals you could ever hope to encounter and were highly regarded and respected by their peers and teachers. Philip and Ann Garvey actively supported the school in every capacity, not only for the benefit of their own children but also dedicating their time to support the school as a whole even after their children had graduated. Philip Garvey is currently assisting our Year 13 students with interview readiness and providing work experience opportunities at his company for Year 11 and 12 students. They will be deeply missed. Our thoughts are with their remaining family members.
Trainer Finbar O'Reilly and strength and conditioning coach Eoin Maguire have stood down from their roles. McGleenan, a former Tyrone forward, mentioned that he has started getting ready for the upcoming season following his first year as a manager at county level. The Cavan team was demoted from Division One of the league in April. Cavan lost their Ulster Championship opener to Monaghan and scored a qualifier win over Offaly, before losing to Tipperary.
Terrorism aims not only to cause harm physically - but also to instill fear and chaos that destabilizes a city or country. This assailant attempted to achieve this goal using the simplest means possible. The days when terrorism exclusively meant large, complex bombs and months of planning are largely gone: western security agencies - particularly MI5 and its partner agencies - are very, very good at identifying those plots and disrupting them. The longer it takes to plan such an attack, the more people who are involved, the more chances there will be for security services to learn what is going on. Since the 2005 suicide attacks, the police have trained and trained and trained for how they would manage a repeat of that atrocity. Those plans have been repeatedly refined - most particularly in the wake of the marauding attacks on Mumbai in 2008 and the horrifying scenes in Paris, Nice and elsewhere. Part of that training has been how to deal with the attacker himself - and some of it has been about how to manage a city; to keep it moving, living and breathing. And that's why the prime minister was able to say Londoners will carry on as normal. The attack began with the assailant driving into people on Westminster Bridge. It's a method of attack that has been repeatedly encouraged by groups including al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the self-styled Islamic State group. It's been promoted online in both organisations' English language magazines. And over countless counter-terrorism trials at the Old Bailey, I have heard evidence of British suspects having this information in their possession. Why choose this method? Because it's simple and, potentially, undetectable until it happens. Of the 13 foiled plots since 2013, by my reckoning around half of them contained one element or other of this attacker's methodology - either an attack involving a vehicle, or a bladed weapon and a determination to act on foot. The two men who murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby in 2013 drove right at the soldier and then got out to hack him to death. Others with similar ideas have been stopped before they could put their plans into action. So why did this one get through? We now know that he was British. Prime Minister Theresa May said that "some years ago" he was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism. "He was a peripheral figure," she said. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Critically, even if he had been on their radar, we don't know if he had said or done anything that merited him being prioritised over other severe threats. The prime minister told the Commons that the case he was involved in was "historic" and he was "not part of the current intelligence picture". The police have been attempting to determine if the assailant acted alone or was part of a larger group since the incident. It is probable that he associates with individuals who share his beliefs, but that does not necessarily imply they were involved in the attack. They will not discount the possibility that there are others out there until they have run all those investigative lines into the ground. There have been arrests - and officers will have been analysing the electronic trail left by the attacker's car as it passed through the city's automatic number plate recognition cameras. They will be pulling every available piece of CCTV to look for further clues - particularly the individual's starting point and last physical meetings with others. Experts will triangulate his mobile phone's movements and look at who he was speaking to and when. They might receive a notification that places him in the vicinity of a recognized suspect - it has occurred previously. We may not be informed about it, but analysts within MI5 and GCHQ could resort to more invasive methods to breach his online accounts and determine what information they can gather. And finally, detectives will hope that some good, old-fashioned policing will turn up a vital clue - perhaps an anonymous call to the anti-terrorist hotline or a quiet word from a neighbour to a local officer. There are some very long hours and days ahead for investigators. Out across the capital, the Metropolitan Police will step up its presence. There will be more armed officers on the streets - but also more beat patrols to reassure communities. Crucially, there will be increased monitoring for community tensions and a hate crime backlash. There is one final question. There is a ring of steel around the Palace of Westminster - but the attacker was able to enter Parliament's grounds through the gates to New Palace Yard, which is below Big Ben. The entrance is guarded by armed officers but, unlike other parts of Parliament, there is no elaborate chicane. There will be inevitable questions about whether this entrance was appropriately protected -  but given the rudimentary nature of this man's murderous plan, it would not have stopped him trying.
Of 209 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), it said only four were meeting national guidelines on IVF treatment. All four - where patients are provided with three rounds of IVF as a component of their treatment - are located in Greater Manchester. The Fertility Fairness advocates highlight Essex and South Norfolk for discontinuing all NHS fertility treatments. Essex was identified as the most challenging location for individuals facing difficulties with conception, as three CCGs in the area have discontinued all NHS fertility treatment. Additionally, South Norfolk CCG has also terminated its NHS fertility services. Across England, only one in six CCGs offers three rounds of IVF, with the majority (60%) offering just one, Fertility Fairness said. Greater Manchester was singled out because it offers even more support than the minimum recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice). A Fertility Fairness spokesman said that in Scotland three cycles were offered, while the NHS in Wales and Northern Ireland offered two and one respectively. It warned the situation could be about to worsen further, with 10% of CCGs in England consulting on reducing or decommissioning services. "This is cruel and unethical, and a national disgrace for the country that pioneered IVF," said Fertility Fairness co-chair Susan Seenan. "Infertility is a disease, and women and men who cannot become parents without medical help are as deserving of healthcare as people with other medical conditions. " Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has said that the government would step in if local health bodies were not meeting clinically agreed standards of care. England health minister Nicola Blackwood said: "I am very disappointed to learn that access to IVF treatment on the NHS has been reduced in some places and it is unacceptable that some clinical commissioning groups have stopped commissioning it completely. "I would strongly encourage all CCGs to implement the Nice fertility guidelines in full, as many CCGs have successfully done. ".
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is set to pledge a range of perks for caregivers, such as a £250 vacation bonus. Statistics from official sources reveal that one out of every eight adults in England and Wales offer unpaid care for their loved ones. Mr Clegg said more must be done to reward the "unsung heroes of British society". Other measures to be announced at the launch in Brecon, Powys, include increasing from £110 per week to £150 the amount people can earn without losing their carer's allowance. Under the plan, the NHS will have a legal duty to identify carers and a new "carer's passport" will offer privileges such as free hospital parking, gym sessions and cinema tickets. At first glance, allocating £150m to help 6. 5 million people is not very much - it's about £23 each. "A £150m package for Britain's 6 parties to benefit from was clearly outlined in the Lib Dems' statement." 5 million carers was announced by the Liberal Democrats today as part of their Disability Manifesto. " How generous is Lib Dem carer package? The party would also consult with businesses to offer five days' paid "care leave" a year. The annual holiday bonus would start at £125 in 2017/18 and would be paid for by a levy on tobacco firms' profits. It would rise to £250 by 2020 in line with economic growth. The money is aimed at easing costs for people looking after family members needing weekly support of 35 hours or more. The Lib Dems expect the measures to benefit more than a million people, costing the government £150m a year in 2017-18, rising to £300m a year by 2020. Mr Clegg said: "More needs to be done to help carers get the support they deserve. " He added: "Our new £150 million Carer's Package will ensure society pays back the service that carers give to their loved ones and the community".
Woods, bidding for a 15th major title, shot 70, while 2003 champion Furyk took 69 and 2001 US PGA winner Toms carded 70 to lead by one at one under par. Clubhouse scores in full Graeme McDowell, the 2010 champion, was one over with Nicolas Colsaerts, John Peterson and Michael Thompson. Holder Rory McIlroy and world number one Luke Donald missed the cut. The world's two top-ranked players were unable to fight back after disappointing first rounds and carded 73 and 72 to end 10 over and 11 over respectively. McIlroy said: "It's just such a demanding golf course and punishes the slightest shot that's off-line or that's maybe not the right distance. " Five-time runner-up Phil Mickelson took 71 to end seven over, but Masters champion Bubba Watson also fell foul of the eight over cut mark with 78, 71 for nine over. The 36-year-old Woods, three shots adrift of leader Michael Thompson in tied second overnight, picked up a shot at the third to take the lead but went backwards with three straight bogeys from the fifth. But he managed to secure two pars before more birdies were achieved at the 10th and 13th holes, and he failed to capitalize on other good opportunities, particularly on the 17th. "It was extremely challenging, and I had to maintain my composure and be patient," Woods stated. "I think I'm in a good spot. This tournament, you just keep plodding along. The kind of players near the top of the leaderboard show exactly what type of game it takes to win a US Open. There's Tiger Woods, of course, who continues to hit more fairways than almost anybody here, 11 of 14 on day two with 14 of 18 greens in regulation. But also Furyk, Toms and McDowell who are all shorter but deadly accurate players, great putters and very patient grinders. And the fact those three are all major champions will certainly give Woods pause for thought. They're unlikely to be intimidated by him and a fascinating weekend lies ahead. "You're just playing for a lot of pars. This is not a tournament where we have to make a bunch of birdies. " Woods's last major triumph came at the 2008 US Open before turmoil in his private life, injury and changing to a new coach derailed his progress. But eight times out of nine when he has held at least a share of the lead after 36 holes at a major he has gone on to win. "It's been a very long time since my swing felt this good - don't forget I went through all of last year hurt and hadn't been able to practise," he added. Furyk, who clinched his only major at Olympia Fields nine years ago, combined two birdies with two bogeys to move into the mix as his form becomes more steady each day. "I kept the ball in the fairway pretty well," said Furyk. I feel stable and confident at this point. I am aware that it will become even more secure and quicker, posing an even greater challenge for the weekend. " Media playback is not supported on this device The 45-year-old, who also has four other top-five finishes in the US Open, said of the typically tough set-ups: "I guess you have to realise at the US Open that par is a really good score and you're going to make some bogeys. "Mentally you have to be in a good frame of mind, and physically you have to be on top of a lot of areas of your game. " Toms joined the leaders late on with two bogeys on his front nine and two birdies on his back nine. "I just hung in there," said Toms, who beat Mickelson for his US PGA title in Atlanta. "I knew not to get frustrated and keep grinding. You have to be mentally ready for anything and never give up. " England's Justin Rose followed his opening 69 with a 75 for four over alongside Ireland's three-time major champion Padraig Harrington (70). Lee Westwood, ranked third in the world, finished at five over par along with Ian Poulter and Marc Warren. Beau Hossler, a seventeen-year-old amateur, briefly held the lead on his own before finishing at three over, while Andy Zhang, who is only fourteen years old, ended at seventeen over after carding 79 and 78.

The remains, believed to be of a 71-year-old female, were found in Fenny Bridges, Honiton around 16:00 GMT on Wednesday, officials said. A 66-year-old male is in custody and undergoing questioning at Heavitree Road police station. The woman has yet to be formally identified but a post-mortem will be carried out later, police said. Devon and Cornwall Police said it was not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
NHS Highland is set to host the sessions in Dingwall starting on 14 September and continuing until the end of the month. The sessions on techniques will be held in conjunction with this year's Lip Reading Awareness Week, taking place from 14 to 19 September. Speech and language therapist Liz Kraft said the skill could help people feel less isolated. Deaf, deafened or hard of hearing individuals who do not utilize sign language and are not integrated into the deaf community may find it challenging to remain connected with their own language and be involved in any community. "Lip reading and managing hearing loss classes have been shown to be of huge benefit and allow anyone with hearing loss to do the very best they can to help themselves. ".
Politics came to a halt today, with leaders from different parties setting aside their disagreements to pay tribute. The referendum campaign, which has been lacking in respect, remains suspended. Insults and exaggerations are never far from political exchanges. But the referendum campaign has included astonishingly harsh attacks on both sides, emotional appeals to our identity that go way beyond the usual. The largest political choice we've faced in years, the campaign has been fierce, with the debate over the EU surprisingly turning vicious in Westminster. However, the death of the MP not only stopped the competition but also shifted the political atmosphere in an instant. And with the vote so soon, and the atmosphere so sombre, it's hard to imagine a full return to such confrontational campaigning before the country decides. Next week, as politicians hit the campaign trail once again, we can expect a more positive and friendly approach. Nevertheless, the momentum and enthusiasm of a campaign remain essential. This break may also have significance.
Crewe has been selected over Stoke-on-Trent as the upcoming major stop on the path to Manchester. Improving transport links in northern England is a key part of the government's transportation plan. The legislation for the initial phase of HS2 has yet to be approved by parliament. The bill for the London to Birmingham section of the route, the biggest in parliamentary history, may not gain Royal Assent for a year. Before that can happen, a committee is going through the planned route inch by inch with those affected. The government hopes the London to Birmingham route will be completed by 2026, and the routes to Manchester and Leeds by 2033. A separate bill will be needed for the Manchester and Leeds routes. Last year, the boss of HS2, Sir David Higgins, said the Â£55. 7bn project should be completed sooner than that. The boss of HS2 recommended taking the line a further 43 miles to Crewe last year. He argued that it's relatively straightforward in engineering terms yet would save a significant amount of time. Now the government's agreed, despite a strong bid to go via Stoke instead. Interestingly, today's announcement doesn't include plans for a new hub station at Crewe. That decision won't be taken until next Autumn. New stations are the most expensive things of all, so it raises the prospect of something else losing out. In the past they've looked at whether a planned new station at Manchester Airport should be postponed although the government suggests that's no longer on the cards, "subject to agreeing an appropriate local funding contribution to the costs". HS2 has dropped out of the headlines since the brand new government pledged unbending support, but there's still a long way to go before MPs even vote on the bill for the first leg, between London and Birmingham. That bill might not get Royal Assent until the end of next year. Still, the project feels a lot more certain than it did a couple of years ago, when the then Shadow chancellor, Ed Balls (how long ago does that feel!) questioned its value for money. I still meet a lot of people who think it's a waste of money with a woolly economic case though. And I don't just mean those with a house on the route. I mean economists and business people with no axe to grind. Reaction: HS2 Birmingham to Crewe 'disappointing setback' The Chancellor, George Osborne also revealed that John Cridland, the former leader of the CBI business group, would head a new organization called Transport for the North, which aims to enhance transportation connections in the North. The revised schedule indicates that a section of the project's second phase is set to be operational just a year after the first phase from London to Birmingham is expected to be completed. "Bringing forward this part of the HS2 route by six years is a massive step in the right direction for the Northern Powerhouse where high-speed rail will play a big role in connecting up the entire region with the rest of the country," the chancellor said. The Treasury said journey times between Crewe and London would be cut by 35 minutes once the new route was open. In his Spending Review last week, Mr Osborne confirmed that the government would spend Â£13bn on improving transport links in the North.
Despite a water temperature of 16C, more than 2,500 people entered the races in Loch Lomond being held throughout the day. Events kicked off at 09:00 with the 0. 5 mile swim and wrapped up at 15:30 with the 5km race. Now in its third year, the Great Scottish Swim offers the opportunity for swimmers of any age or skill level to participate. The event also hosted the national one-mile open water championship race as part of the elite competition, which saw some of the world's best open water swimmers compete against Scotland's top home-grown talent. The men's race at The Great Scottish Swim was described as "highly competitive," featuring 2014 Commonwealth Champion Ross Murdoch from the nearby town of Balloch, as well as Commonwealth silver medallist and World Champion Robbie Renwick. Christian Riechert won the race with a time of 18:05:06. The women's competition showcased Christine Jennings, a two-time national US 10km champion, competing against Keri-Anne Payne of Team GB, who is a two-time World Champion and Olympic Silver medallist. Ms Jennings narrowly defeated Ms Payne to secure the top spot by less than half a second. Alex Jackson, Great Swim series event director, said: "It's great to see the appetite for open water swimming increasing, the trend for taking on longer more challenging swims shows no sign of slowing down, over 250 people will take on the 5k challenge on Saturday. "The opportunity to swim in such an iconic location continues to resonate with our swimmers not just in Scotland but around the UK, many are travelling up to enjoy a fantastic weekend in Scotland. ".
The world-first procedure at Necker Children's Hospital in Paris offers hope to millions of people with the blood disorder. Scientists altered the genetic instructions in his bone marrow so it made healthy red blood cells. So far, the therapy has worked for 15 months and the child is no longer on any medication. Sickle cell disease causes normally round red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, to become shaped like a sickle. These deformed cells can lock together to block the flow of blood around the body. This can cause intense pain, organ damage and can be fatal. The teenager who received the treatment had so much internal damage he needed to have his spleen removed and his hips replaced. Every month he had to go into hospital to have a blood transfusion to dilute his defective blood. But when he was 13, doctors at the Necker Children's Hospital in Paris did something unique. Doctors removed his bone marrow - the part of the body that makes blood. They subsequently modified it genetically in a laboratory to correct the deficiency in his DNA responsible for the illness. Sickle cell results from a mistake in the guidelines for producing the protein haemoglobin, which is tightly compressed into red blood cells. A virus was used to infect the bone marrow with new, correct instructions. The corrected bone marrow was then put back into the patient. The results in the New England Journal of Medicine showed the teenager has been making normal blood since the procedure 15 months ago. Philippe Leboulch, a professor of medicine at the University of Paris, told the BBC News website: "So far the patient has no sign of the disease, no pain, no hospitalisation. He no longer requires a transfusion so we are quite pleased with that. Prof Leboulch is hesitant to use the term "cure" since this is only the initial patient to go through clinical trials. But the study does show the potential power of gene therapy to transform the lives of people with sickle cell. "I think it's very significant, essential they've given him his life back," said Dr Deborah Gill from the gene medicine research group at the University of Oxford. She told the BBC: "I've worked in gene therapy for a long time and we make small steps and know there's years more work. "But here you have someone who has received gene therapy and has complete clinical remission - that's a huge step forward. " However, the expensive procedure can only be carried out in cutting-edge hospitals and laboratories, while most sickle cell patients are in Africa. The next big challenge will be to transform this pioneering science into something that really can help millions of people. Follow James on Twitter. Source: NHS Choices.
There have been weekly protests by the Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West (Pegida) since October. A record 18,000 people turned out on Monday at one rally in Dresden. But counter demonstrations have sprung up and the group has been condemned by senior German politicians. Thousands of people marched in Berlin, Cologne, Dresden and Stuttgart. In Berlin, police said that some 5,000 counter-demonstrators blocked hundreds of Pegida supporters from marching along their planned route. A total of 22,000 anti-Pegida demonstrators rallied in Stuttgart, Muenster and Hamburg, according to the DPS news agency. But in Dresden, police said that 18,000 people turned up for just one anti-immigration rally. The counter-demonstration attracted 3,000 people. In Cologne, the authorities switched off the lights of the city's cathedral as a way of warning Pegida supporters they were supporting "extremists". "We don't think of it as a protest, but we would like to make the many conservative Christians [who support Pegida] think about what they are doing," the dean of the cathedral, Norbert Feldhoff, told the BBC. Only about 250 Pegida supporters showed up in Cologne, compared to thousands of counter-demonstrators. Much of the city centre was also plunged into darkness as lights were switched off at major buildings and bridges across the Rhine, according to the news agency DPA. "Today, there is really a democratic sign being sent and a lot of people in Cologne are expressing their opinion," said Cologne mayor Juergen Roters. "They want to stress that we here in Cologne do not want to have anything to do with right-wing extremists and xenophobic people. " In Dresden, carmaker Volkswagen said it was also keeping its manufacturing plant dark to show that the company "stands for an open, free and democratic society. " German Chancellor Angela Merkel attacked the movement in her new year speech, saying its leaders have "prejudice, coldness, even hatred in their hearts". Kathrin Oertel, one of the main organisers of Pegida, responded in a speech at the rally in Dresden. She said that there was "political repression" in Germany once again. "Or how would you see it when we are insulted or called racists or Nazis openly by all the political mainstream parties and media for our justified criticism of Germany's asylum seeker policies and the non-existent immigration policy?" German journalist Sigrun Rottman told the BBC that Pegida protesters were mixed but that the marches did include right-wing and racist groups. She said it was important to note that Dresden, compared to other German cities, had very few immigrants, and even fewer Muslim residents. Many supporters there felt "hard done-by" and unrepresented by mainstream politics and media, she added. Opponents of Pegida, specifically, utilized social media to express their disapproval. The hashtag #nokoegida - pertaining to the demonstrations in Cologne - was popular on Twitter in Germany on Tuesday. "Germany appears to be demonstrating to Europe how to suppress a xenophobic movement tonight," journalist Nicolas Kayser-Bril tweeted. A survey conducted by Germany's Stern magazine among slightly more than 1,000 individuals revealed that one out of eight Germans would participate in an anti-Islam demonstration if Pegida arranged one in their vicinity. Germany receives more refugees and asylum seekers than any other EU country. Many of those have come from war-torn Syria.
The ITV reality show attracts fans to filming locations, nightspots like Sugar Hut and its stars' businesses. Brentwood council member Chris Hossack noted that certain individuals were not at ease with the atmosphere surrounding hen nights and Saturday nights in Brentwood. Tour guide Courtney Harrison mentioned that tourists had never been a source of trouble. "We've never had an issue with anyone on the tour - it's more so the people in Brentwood," he said. Conservative Mr Hossack said credit should be given to "people who were in the show early on for their entrepreneurial spirit". But he added: "This whole thing of people coming in from all four corners of the UK, hen nights, stag dos, walking round Brentwood with selfie sticks - I think it's putting off a demographic of local people. "Brentwood is predominantly for Brentwood people. Yes, there are people coming in from outside, and spending money, and that's good for the economy so we shouldn't decry that. But we must remember that residents in Brentwood also desire to utilize their town. It is important to take into account the needs of the local community alongside the economic vitality of the town. " Gareth Barratt, a Labour borough councillor, said the programme's popularity "genuinely provides a benefit to our town". "We actually have people spending money in our town who aren't our own citizens. I think it's always easy to find extreme views," he added. Neither ITV or Lime Pictures, the company which makes the show, endorse Towie tours.
Mr Mckeague, from Fife, vanished after a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September. April Oliver, 21, had been in a relationship with the 23-year-old, who is based at nearby RAF Honington. Ms Oliver, who found out she was pregnant with his child two weeks after he went missing, expressed: "I had to make a huge decision on my own. " Live updates on this and other Suffolk news Corrie Mckeague: What do we know about his disappearance? "I was wishing and praying for his return so we could decide together," Miss Oliver, from Norfolk, added Mr Mckeague did not know his girlfriend was expecting before he vanished. She found out the information in October. The couple, who connected through an online dating platform, had been in a relationship for approximately five months before Mr Mckeague disappeared. Miss Oliver described him as an "absolute gentleman". "I've never known anyone as sweet and sociable as him," she said to BBC Look East. "I wish more than anything for him to come back and walk through that door." " Miss Oliver said she was on holiday in America when Mr Mckeague went missing, but returned to the UK as soon as she heard the news. "I was concerned," she added. "I knew it was out of character. I was quite worried. " She said she decided to speak about her pregnancy so that she could focus on looking after herself and her baby without any intrusion. "Most people only tell their close friends but I'm faced with a decision where I need to tell near enough the whole UK. "It's hard and it's going to add another level of stress I don't really need but it's something that has to be done," said Miss Oliver. Mr Mckeague's mother, Nicola Urquhart, went with Miss Oliver for the scan. She said: "It's incredibly difficult to bounce my head from the excitement of a new baby to what we're actually trying to focus on, which is finding Corrie. " Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline, was last seen on CCTV walking alone in Bury St Edmunds at 03:24 BST. A team of private investigators, paid for by online crowdfunding, began inquiries on behalf of the family to complement the Suffolk Police investigation on Friday.
An industrial tribunal found Martin Sheil, 51, had been unfairly dismissed by Stena Line Irish Sea Ferries. It also ruled he had been the victim of discrimination and harassment at work on the grounds of sexual orientation. The company had "adopted a far too passive approach to unpleasant banter", the tribunal held. Stena Line is appealing against the ruling. The tribunal panel found Mr Sheil had been subjected to homophobic comments over a period of weeks or months. Mr Sheil brought the case arguing he had been unfairly dismissed following an incident involving himself and a colleague who had been taking part in homophobic abuse. The tribunal found the company had failed to investigate Mr Sheil's allegations, and had not considered whether these were mitigating circumstances. Awarding £37,500 of the total amount for unfair dismissal, the tribunal said "the flaws in the investigatory and disciplinary procedure render the dismissal substantively unfair". Mr Sheil was supported by the Equality Commission in bringing his case. Chief Commissioner Michael Wardlow stated that the incident illustrates the devastating effect on a person who endured constant abuse at their workplace due to their sexual orientation. "The tribunal noted that while the company had policies meant to deter such behavior, there was no proof that they actively worked to stop it," he remarked. "That posts a warning to all employers that they must take active steps to ensure that their policies against harassment and discrimination are known, understood and practiced by their entire workforce. " Mr Sheil said his job had been important to him, and he had worked to keep his private life and work life separate. "I endured months of abuse in silence," he said. "The reason I took this case was to try and make sure that others don't have to go through this. " The panel found that because Mr Sheil had taken action on the abuse himself rather than reporting it to management, he had contributed partly to his own dismissal so his compensation was reduced by 10%. There was also a 20% reduction to reflect the panel's estimate of the chance that his dismissal was fair. A Stena Line spokesman said the company was disappointed by the tribunal's decision. "Stena Line has lodged an appeal which is scheduled to take place in the Court of Appeal in September 2014," he said.
In June, the mobile phone network had said it was talking to Liberty Global over "a possible exchange of selected assets between the two companies". The two firms never disclosed which assets they were thinking of swapping. The deal was seen as a key part of Vodafone's strategy and shares in the telecoms firm fell 5% in London. Two weeks ago Liberty Global chairman John Malone had warned the two sides were struggling to find common ground. Shares in the cable giant have also fallen in early trading in New York, losing 8% to $44 at 17:20 (BST). Claire Enders, creator of research company Enders Analysis, questioned why individuals were let down when mission impossible failed to succeed. She pointed out that one potential issue could be Liberty Global's steep valuation of its key property, Virgin Media. Regulatory issues in Germany, where Vodafone and Liberty Global own the two biggest cable operators, and the Netherlands also clouded the talks. The telecoms industry has been going through a period of deal making as phone companies attempt to offer their customers packages of television, broadband, mobile and traditional phone services. Investors have been keen to see Vodafone's next move after it sold a 45% stake in US-based Verizon Wireless for $130bn (£84bn) in 2013 - one of the biggest corporate deals in history. Last year it acquired Germany's Kabel Deutschland for €7. 7bn (£5. 7bn), and was also linked to a deal for BSkyB.
Ellie Butler, six, was found with fatal injuries while her father looked after her at their home in October 2013. Ben Butler, 36, from south west London, denies murder and child cruelty. In the clip shown to the Old Bailey "bossy" Peppa instructs her friends to "jump up and down". The prosecution say Mr Butler caused Ellie's head injuries in a violent rage. After the jurors watched the video, prosecutor Ed Brown QC asked them not to be swayed by "fanciful or speculative reasoning or entertain fanciful suggestions" but to use their "collective common sense and experience of life". In his closing speech, he urged them to look at the medical evidence presented in court and the atmosphere in the Butler household at the time of the child's death. Mr Butler "dominated" the family with "self-centred control" and "a temper that could break at any moment", the prosecutor said. He stated that the child's injuries were so severe and disastrous that they could not have been caused by an unintentional fall, and also mentioned that the defense team had attempted to leverage the six-year-old's past injuries. Mr Brown stated: "The injuries that occurred before do not lessen the seriousness and abruptness of the injuries that led to the young girl's death."
Media playback is not supported on this device Wales go into Saturday's semi-final against France with Gatland claiming: "We are not whiter than white. " Media playback is not supported on this device While England were damaged by stories of late-night revelry, the Welsh have been portrayed as virtually teetotal. "A lot [has been] made of us being like monks and that there has been an alcohol ban. "There has been no ban on alcohol in this squad," Gatland insisted. Some of the stuff has been self-imposed by players. We have had a couple of nights when we have gone back to the hotel and we've had a drink. "And a couple of times we have spoken with [captain] Sam [Warburton] and the senior players about putting the curfew on when the players come back after going out. "You can't keep a lid on everything. You play a night game and there's a lot adrenalin and you say to players 'look go out if you are back in the hotel by 1. 30 in the morning'. They might have gone to the casino [but] they are not drinking alcohol - some of them might have had a beer. "There is a lot made that we are whiter than white. We definitely are not. " But Gatland admitted he has been impressed with the attitude of his players both on and off the field. "These guys have been great ambassadors in this campaign for Wales," said the coach, whose side set up a meeting with France by beating Ireland in the quarter-finals. "That's what's been important. There has been a sea-shift in terms of the professionalism and the way we have prepared. "These guys have known right from day one that we were in pretty good shape heading towards this World Cup and if we looked after ourselves, both on and off the field, we could made an impact. I think we have done that. " Gatland was quick to point out that he has taken little pleasure from England's controversial World Cup, which was haunted by a string of off-the-field controversies. The conduct of some England players resulted in front-page headlines throughout the tournament, prompting the Rugby Football Union to launch a review of player behaviour following the country's quarter-final exit at the hands of France. On one occasion, captain Mike Tindall found his conduct under scrutiny after a group of players were given permission by team manager Martin Johnson to enjoy a night out drinking in Queenstown. As a coach I don't take any satisfaction whatsoever or any pleasure in the criticism that has been heaped on England Tindall, who married the Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips in July, later issued an apology for misleading the England management over his movements, having initially claimed he did not go on to another bar afterwards. There were other indiscretions, too, notably when centre Manu Tuilagi was formally warned by police and fined £3,000 by England rugby officials after jumping from a ferry in Auckland. "As a coach, I don't take any satisfaction whatsoever or any pleasure in the criticism that has been heaped on England," insisted Gatland. "I know what it's like to be on the wrong side of the media in the past. As a fellow coach, there are a lot of good friends of mine in the England set-up. "I don't take any pleasure - and I'm sure the Welsh team don't take any pleasure - on all that criticism that has been heaped on England. "So, I just want to say we are no monks, we are not whiter than white and we have had our problems in the past. ".
The Prime Minister's decision to announce a sudden general election is a sudden change in direction that could derail Stormont's struggling institutions even more. Efforts to rescue devolution came to a standstill before Easter with little chance of reaching an agreement. With the Democratic Unionist Party warning Northern Ireland was heading towards direct rule, the prospect of a Westminster poll complicates matters even further. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said the snap general election on 8 June would provide the people of Northern Ireland with the opportunity to "vote for the union". She was criticised after the Northern Ireland Assembly election last month because the poll showed a surge in support for Sinn Féin and the end of the unionist majority at Stormont. Mrs Foster has called on her voters to "unite around a strong Democratic Unionist Party that will advocate for them in Parliament". Sinn Féin welcomed news of the Westminster poll, with leader Gerry Adams tweeting: "So Ms May has called a British General Election. Sinn Féin is up 4 that! Another chance 2 vote against Brexit & 4 progress. " However, Colum Eastwood, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) was less than pleased about the prospect. "By calling an election in the middle of talks, it is evident how little @TheresaMayPM values our peace process," he posted on Twitter. Northern Ireland's two main parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, have been pointing fingers at each other for weeks over the lack of progress in restoring Stormont's power-sharing government. Under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, any new executive government must be a coalition of both unionists and nationalists. However, long-running rows over a proposed Irish language act and deep divisions over how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles are holding up a deal. A snap general election complicates the talks process at Stormont and is a scenario that was not factored in when the discussions were paused for Easter. Those talks are expected to resume again shortly but history suggests that it is always difficult to cut a political deal at election time. It is very hard to hold talks in the morning with your opponent and then go canvassing in the evening. Political parties react differently when there is an election looming. The DUP and Sinn Féin are also diametrically split over Brexit - the issue driving Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to hold a general election. Mrs May said the poll would "guarantee certainty" during negotiations with the EU, after Labour, the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats threatened to vote against her government's final Brexit deal. Northern Ireland currently has 18 MPs, with the DUP out in front with eight Westminster seats - making it the fifth largest party in the House of Commons. Sinn Féin has four Westminster seats, having lost one in the last general election in 2015. However, under its long-standing policy of abstentionism in protest against British rule, Sinn Féin MPs do not take their seats in the Commons. The Ulster Unionist Party was the biggest winner in the last Westminster poll, having gained two seats. Like Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party lost a seat in the 2015 vote, while the Social Democratic and Labour Party remained static with three seats. Could we have a general election and a Northern Ireland Assembly election on the same day? Our political correspondent Stephen Walker says: "Technically you could - although the government may want to call an assembly election only as a last resort. "There is an argument that two elections on the one day can be cumbersome. "In terms of a lack of an Executive being formed in Northern Ireland, Secretary of State James Brokenshire needs to push through emergency financial measures to keep things afloat, like rates. "If an election does take place in June, he will have to do that in the coming days, before the Westminster parliament is dissolved. " In the most recent Stormont poll, the DUP retained its position as the largest political party in Northern Ireland. However, its lead over Sinn Féin was cut from 10 seats to just one. The snap election was held in March after the power-sharing government was brought down by a row over a botched green energy scheme. The result was a close shave for the DUP, and a difficult day for unionism in general, as it brought an end to the unionist majority at Stormont for the first time in history. Unionists and nationalists now hold an equal number of seats, with non-aligned parties holding the balance of power. However, how much power any of them will wield is still unclear, as more than two months after the poll, the parties have not been able to form a coalition. Sinn Féin called for a second snap Assembly election if no deal is reached by May, but the DUP warned another poll would not solve the issues - voters could end up with direct rule from Westminster. But who will be calling the shots from Westminster? It'll be a long, hot summer -  in the political world at least.
L/Cpl Scott Hetherington, 22, from Middleton, Greater Manchester, died at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, on 2 January. He served as a vehicle commander with the 2nd Battalion, Duke of Lancaster's Regiment. L/Cpl Hetherington is the first UK soldier to die in Iraq in almost eight years. The 22-year-old, who was nicknamed "Snowball", had only been in Iraq for a month when he died and had only recently become a father to a daughter. Friends hailed him as a "true hero" and a "brave lion" on Facebook. The soldier's commanding officer Lt Col Rob Singleton stated that L/Cpl Scott Hetherington was an excellent soldier and top-notch leader. He described him as completely professional and skilled, with a vibrant personality, sense of humor, and contagious enthusiasm. L/Cpl Hetherington belonged to Blenheim Company and served as a vehicle commander in the Force Protection Platoon. His unit was based at Weeton Barracks near Blackpool. The British Army is present in Iraq as a component of the UK's campaign against Islamic State fighters. About 150 soldiers from the battalion are being deployed to Iraq for six months. They form part of a 500-strong Army force being sent to train Iraqi and Kurdish security forces.

"It doesn't look great with Paul. It looks like an upper hamstring but we will probably have to wait until Monday to give it a scan," said Schmidt. Fly-half Johnny Sexton is also set for a scan on a groin strain. Peter O'Mahony suffered a suspected knee injury but is less of a concern. Lock O'Connell, aged 35, will be departing from the world of international rugby to join Toulon following the conclusion of the World Cup, during which he earned 108 caps. Alongside concerns about injuries for the upcoming quarter-final against Argentina in Cardiff on Sunday, flanker Sean O'Brien may potentially be facing disciplinary action for an alleged punch thrown at Pascal Pape. Sexton, who scored two quick penalties, was the initial member of the group to exit after 25 minutes due to a strong tackle from Louis Picamoles. Schmidt showed worry for O'Connell, who was carried off on a stretcher at half-time, and O'Mahony, who departed in the second half. "With Johnny, it looks like an adductor to me, but it's not the learned eye of a medic. So we are probably going to get him scanned tomorrow. "He's already talking about next week. I'm not sure whether that means he'll be playing. He's never short of advice. "O'Mahony didn't seem too bad, we are hopeful. I think it's a twisted ankle or knee. He was walking pretty well in the changing room and hopefully he'll be OK. " Number eight Jamie Heaslip, part of a formidable Irish back-row, said the team had crucially not panicked after the injuries. "At half-time, it was actually quite a calm changing room. Everyone just kind of switched into their role and adapted a bit to the solutions, who was fitting in where and how we were going to proceed," Heaslip said. "All the guys who stepped in put in a massive amount of work. " Ian Madigan came on for Sexton and directed the Irish team well, kicking two penalties and converting Conor Murray's try after Rob Kearney had crossed for the first on 50 minutes. "You're always delighted when a young guy comes through the system," Schmidt said. "One thing that helped Ian was the quality of the go-forward ball that Jamie and the pack offered him. It got him on the front foot and made his job a little bit easier. "There are a lot of sore bodies in that changing room. The lads were just physically and emotionally drained at the end of it and from this point on that is what you've got to give when you get the chance to wear that jersey.

The Warriors remain two points behind leaders Hull and will drop to third if Warrington beat Wakefield on Sunday. Solomona and Paul McShane scored tries to give the home team a 12-6 lead at halftime, while Sam Powell scored in response. Two more tries from Solomona in the second period sealed the victory, despite Wigan mounting a late comeback attempt. Ben Flower sandwiched Solomona's second-half brace and the Warriors reduced a 14-point deficit to four points when John Bateman and Lee Mossop both crossed. Their dreams of an improbable victory were stopped by last-minute efforts from Ryan Hampshire and Oliver Holmes for the Tigers. Solomona has now scored 31 Super League tries in 2016 and is comfortably leading the division's scoring chart, with Corey Thompson of Widnes in second place with 20 goals. Castleford: Dorn; Hampshire, Crooks, Minikin, Solomona; Chase, Gale; Springer, Milner, Patrick, Holmes, Savelio, Moors. Replacements: Jewitt, McShane, Cook, Millington. Wigan: Tomkins; Charnley, Gelling, Sarginson, Manfredi; Williams, Smith; Crosby, Powell, Flower, Bateman, Isa, Sutton. Replacements: Farrell, Mossop, Tautai, Nuuausala. Referee: Joe Cobb.
Downpours and high winds on Thursday caused problems on the roads and the rail network. Whitesands in Dumfries flooded for the second time in a week and about 500 homes in the region lost power after a lightning strike. The Met Office has issued yellow "be prepared" warnings for further heavy rain over the weekend. They extend to the south west of Scotland, Lothian and Borders, as well as the Strathclyde area. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) had a single flood alert remaining on Friday - for west central Scotland. Latest updates and information BBC Travel online updates BBC weather updates Scotland-wide travel updates Met Office weather warnings @BBCScotlandNews severe weather list Traveline Scotland Sepa floodline On Thursday, a landslip caused by heavy rain in the Thornhill area closed the rail line between Kilmarnock and Dumfries. Services were anticipated to be disrupted until 13:00 on Friday. Additionally, Perth and Kinross Council brought in 2,000 sandbags to restock supplies following flooding in the Perthshire village of Comrie, near Crieff, on Monday. Fire crews piled sandbags next to the river bank to prevent further flooding and specialist water rescue teams pumped out drains. Several roads in Galashiels in the Borders experienced flooding, leading the council to shut them down and supply additional sandbags. Dumfries and Galloway Council said flooding at the Whitesands peaked between 20:00 and 21:00 on Thursday night. The waters extended from the foot of Friars Vennel through Brewery Street along the car park to the bottom of Bank Street. The council said its out-of-hours standby arrangements were being put in place to cope with any further problems over the weekend.
Kim Jong-nam is thought to have been poisoned as he waited to board a flight in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Monday. Local authorities are carrying out an autopsy to establish the exact cause of Mr Kim's death, but Pyongyang has reportedly objected. Police have arrested one woman in connection with the death, but are still looking for other suspects. According to reports, North Korea sent a number of representatives to the hospital where the autopsy was being conducted on Wednesday to ask for the return of the body. Malaysia has yet to formally confirm that the dead man, who was travelling under the name Kim Chol, is Kim Jong-nam. Malaysia has not bowed to the North Korean demands. One insider informed Reuters that Malaysia has stated it will not succumb to pressure and will adhere to established procedures. " Malaysian authorities also announced the arrest of Doan Thi Huong, 28. Police said the arrested suspect, who was alone and in possession of a Vietnamese travel document, was identified from CCTV footage taken at the airport. South Korean media have widely reported that two women, said to be North Korean agents, were involved and fled the airport in a taxi, though Malaysian police have not confirmed those details. North Korea's foreign assassinations A grainy image broadcast in South Korea and Malaysia shows a woman wearing a white T-shirt with the letters "LOL" written on the front. Earlier, Malaysia state news agency Bernama reported that a woman from Myanmar was detained at the airport. It is unclear if that report was referring to the woman now under arrest. If confirmed, this would be the most high-profile death linked to North Korea since Kim Jong-un's uncle, Chang Song-thaek, was executed in 2013. The government of South Korea has said it is certain it is him, with its spy agency is said to have told lawmakers they believe Mr Kim was poisoned. Kim Jong-nam was attacked on Monday morning while waiting at the budget terminal of Kuala Lumpur International Airport for a 10:00 flight to Macau, Malaysian newspaper reports say, quoting police. Exactly how the attack unfolded is still unclear. Officials and witnesses have variously said he was splashed with a chemical or had a cloth placed over his face. Earlier reports spoke of a "spray" being used or a needle. He died on the way to hospital. It was not the first time Mr Kim had travelled under an assumed identity: he was caught trying to enter Japan using a false passport in 2001. He told officials he had been planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland. The Tokyo incident is thought by some analysts to have spoilt Kim Jong-nam's chances of succeeding his father, Kim Jong-il, who died in 2011. Bypassed in favour of his youngest half-brother for succession, Kim Jong-nam kept a low profile, spending most of his time overseas in Macau, mainland China and Singapore. He later spoke out against his family's dynastic control of North Korea and in a 2012 book  was quoted as saying he believed his younger half-brother lacked leadership qualities. He had claimed he had no desire to take on the leadership role himself. North Korea's enigmatic first family Unnamed sources from the US government suspect he was poisoned by agents from North Korea. South Korean spy chief Lee Byung-ho told South Korean MPs that Pyongyang had wanted to kill Kim Jong-nam for several years, but that he was being protected by China. Some experts doubt why Kim Jong-un would want to assassinate his half-brother, considering the dangers involved, potential for embarrassment, and the lack of threat he posed to Kim's rule. However, there have been reports of assassination attempts targeting Kim in the past. A North Korean spy jailed by South Korea in 2012 is said to have admitted trying to organise a hit-and-run accident targeting him. The secretive state has a long history of sending agents overseas to carry out assassinations, attacks and kidnappings.
The Vive's release was delayed after what chief executive Cher Wang described as a "very, very big technological breakthrough". This has been revealed to be a camera system that allows the wearer to see objects in the physical room around them, helping to avoid collisions. Some have questioned whether the device will be affordable, though. By pressing a button on a handheld controller, the user can see objects near them ghosted in to the virtual reality environment. This merging of physical and digital is intended as a safety feature - and a solution to one of the practical problems facing VR. HTC plans to launch the Vive in April. Pre-orders for a rival PC-powered headset, the Rift by Oculus, are set to begin on Wednesday. However, the Facebook-owned firm has yet to reveal when they will be delivered. The other major headset on show at the Vegas event is the PlayStation VR, which works with Sony's games console. "For too long, the promise of virtual reality has been little more than a promise," said Ms Wang. "Today we stand on the precipice of a new era. Vive is creating a world where the only limit is human imagination. " The headset's improvements over a version revealed in February include: HTC would not reveal any details on pricing, but when pushed it acknowledged the cost might prove a barrier to mass-market adoption. "It is a very good experience but if you already have, say a PlayStation, then PlayStation VR is going to be a quicker and cheaper way to get into it," said Stuart Miles, editor of tech site Pocket-lint. Today, in Vegas, I stood on the deck of a shipwreck and watched a blue whale float past - all in the comfort of a hotel suite. I was trying out HTC's new, improved virtual reality headset and it was quite an experience. The ability for 360-degree viewing makes it very immersive and the content is compelling. But whether I would invest in it is another matter. At Christmas, my children played around with the much cheaper and currently available Google Cardboard and while that is a totally different experience it seemed to satisfy their immediate VR needs. Competition in the virtual reality market is primed to be fierce in 2016, according to Michael Goodman of Strategy Analytics. "This is like a bunch of competitors, right at the starting line, eying each other just before the gun goes off," he said. Attempts to popularise VR flopped in the 1990s, but Mr Goodman said that a positive sign this time was that several content-producing firms had already announced VR titles and franchises before the headsets had gone on sale. "That is truly unheard of in the media entertainment industry," he remarked. HTC also revealed three health-related gadgets in collaboration with fitness expert Under Armour. They will be sold together for $400 (Â£270) in a product titled HealthBox. The first is the UA Band, an all-day wristband for tracking activity, exercise and sleep. The second, the UA Heart Rate monitor, is designed to be strapped to the wearer's chest during workouts in order to detect heartbeats and calculate calories burned. Finally, there is the UA Scale, a wi-fi connected set of scales which sync with a companion app so that users can track weight fluctuations over time. "There is nothing amazingly new here," remarked Mr Miles. "Rather, it is the sum of its parts and some will like the ease of a $400 box set for health and fitness.

The two men could not be separated after completing the 31. In a five-hour, two-minute, and 47-second race on Sunday, a top three finish was achieved by James Quirk, completing the race 10 minutes behind the leaders. Karen Chiarello, the top female participant, placed fifth. The route mimics the Parish Walk from Peel to Bride and then on to Ramsey. The event was renamed in 2016 with all proceeds going to the Firefighters Charity, which provides assistance to serving firefighters, retired firefighters and their families.
Posh hit the front after just 25 seconds as Tom Nichols steered in a Paul Taylor cut-back, but they found themselves trailing to two deflected goals in quick succession. Goalkeeper Luke McGee was wrong-footed as Ched Evans levelled in the 22nd minute before Liam O'Neil looped in his first Spireites goal from 25 yards. Posh ace Gwion Edwards produced a stunning equaliser on the stroke of half-time when darting inside and launching a long-range blast past Ryan Fulton. They restored their advantage in similarly classy style nine minutes into the second period when Taylor exchanged passes with Nichols before slamming home a first-time shot from just outside the box. The same two men tormented Chesterfield again 10 minutes later with Taylor releasing top-scorer Nichols to bag his eighth of the season. Michael Bostwick completed a rampant second-half showing from Posh with a typically thunderous blast from 20 yards with eight minutes to go. Chesterfield's misery was compounded when defender Lawrence Maguire was carried off on a stretcher. Report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Peterborough United 5, Chesterfield 2.

Physicists at the university utilized an ultrasound array to apply pressure on an object and draw it closer to the energy source, a concept typically found in science fiction like Star Trek or Star Wars. This marks the first instance of using such a beam to manipulate objects larger than microscopic targets. The technology could be put to use in medicine, helping to develop ultrasound-based clinical techniques. Scientists in Dundee worked together with researchers in Southampton and Illinois on the research, and the results have been published in the scientific journal Physical Review Letters. In another project inspired by science fiction, the team at the Institute for Medical Science and Technology (Imsat) at the university created a "sonic screwdriver" similar to Doctor Who, also using ultrasound technology. Dr. Christine Demore from Imsat stated that this is the initial instance of showcasing a functional acoustic tractor beam, and the first time such a beam has been utilized to manipulate objects larger than microscopic ones. "We were able to demonstrate the capability to apply enough force on an object approximately one centimeter in size to either hold it in place or move it, by aiming two energy beams from the ultrasound array towards the rear of the object. " " The team used an ultrasound device that is already clinically approved for use in MRI-guided surgery. The team's work was carried out as part of a Â£3. 6m programme initiated by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, combining expertise at four UK universities in Bristol, Dundee, Glasgow and Southampton with industrial firms. Professor Sandy Cochran, of the University of Dundee, said: "Our partnership with industry has been vital to developing devices and capabilities that are delivering unprecedented sophistication in the field of ultrasound.

"Sometimes things need to be said, and fights need to be fought even if they are unpopular. To the closeted atheists, you are not alone, and you deserve equality. " So goes the rousing speech from the American Atheists president, David Silverman, in the opening moments of the first US television broadcaster dedicated to those who do not believe in God, Atheist TV. A series of testimonies from prominent atheists then follows. "It's one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life and I completely advocate people 'coming out'," says Mark Hatcher, from Black Atheists of America. "Coming out" is how many atheists in the USA describe what remains, for many, a very difficult admission to make publicly. At one of the biggest gatherings of atheist students in the country, in Columbus, Ohio, Jamila Bey from the Secular Student Alliance said there were many attendees who were nervous about being interviewed and had indicated so by what they were wearing around their neck. "Red lanyards mean 'You may not talk to me'," says Bey. "A number of the students we have aren't 'out'. Their parents may not know that they are atheist or questioning their religion. " She said many were worried about being ostracised or were even scared of violence if they revealed they did not believe in God. Lasan Dancay-Bangura, 22, is happy to talk to us. He is, after all, head of his university's atheist student group. He lets out a deep, sad sigh as he recalls the moment he told his mother he was an atheist. "She was extremely upset from the start. Things were really not good," he says. "After a while I think she just accepted it. We still don't talk about it. It looks like she's not going to kick me out. " Dancay-Bangura admits that he still has not told his father. "I don't want our relationship to be destroyed because of that," he says. "You hear it all the time. " "And you hear about people being kicked out, and sent to bible camps where they're forced to be religious. I don't want to lose my father to that. " The parents of Katelyn Campbell, 19, from West Virginia, have been very supportive of her stance as an atheist. Her problem has been other members of the community. "In high school, when I walked down the hallway it would be completely silent, or I would be spat on," Katelyn says. Two years ago, she protested against the inclusion of religion and abstinence in her school sex education classes. She continues to be affected by it. "I frequently feel uneasy when I'm in public places in my hometown because people tend to confront me about that topic, which involves values that are deeply personal and private," she explains. A recent poll conducted by the Pew Research Centre shows Americans would rather have a president who was either in their 70s, or openly gay, or who had never held any public office than one that was atheist. Astonishingly, a previous poll by Pew suggested respondents in the US regarded atheists as less trustworthy than rapists. One of Atheist TV's new phone-in programmes, The Atheist Experience, has already had a taste of how many Americans perceive "non-believers". "So you were studying to be a minister, and now you don't believe in God? You're the devil," one caller tells the host. "You are a Marxist, you are an atheist, and you are from Russia," another person mentions. At the atheist student event in Ohio, they are aiming to make a difference. T-shirts are laid out for sale on one of the vending tables. "Godless Goddess" says one; "This is what an atheist looks like" says another. Beside the stall stands Andrew Seidel, an attorney for the Freedom from Religion Foundation. "Many Americans think they have never met another atheist, but that is because so many are afraid to publicly acknowledge it," says Andrew. "The way we'll win this fight is because of demographics. Just like it was really important for the LGBT movement to come out of the closet, it's important for us to say it loud and say it proud, 'I'm an atheist!'" Who is an atheist? â€¢2% of US adults say they are atheists â€¢67% of them are men â€¢26% of them see themselves as spiritual Source: Pew Research Center And it does appear the demographics are changing, particularly among the young, where the proportion of those identifying themselves as "religiously unaffiliated" is rising. But America has a much higher proportion of people who say religion is very important to them as compared to European countries. "America is an anomaly because, number one, we were founded by Puritans," says Jamila Bey from the Secular Student Alliance. More recently, particularly for the African-American community in the civil rights struggle, but also for many other minority communities, Bey says she feels religion became a way of gaining acceptance. "It was a way to say 'I'm a good Christian, you shouldn't turn fire hoses on me, and you should let my child go to the school with little white children, Jesus loves us all'," she says. The new TV channel is part of atheist groups' own civil rights movement. But real acceptance, particularly for those serving in public office, in a country where no serving congressman or woman is openly atheist, could still be some way off.
It relates to spending in his unsuccessful 2012 bid for re-election when his campaign costs were more than twice the legal limit. Mr Sarkozy, 61, was questioned all day on Tuesday by magistrates before being informed he was under investigation. He has repeatedly denied knowledge of the overspending. He has said he was not involved in the details of his campaign finance. The move is a prelude to a possible trial but does not necessarily mean Mr Sarkozy will be prosecuted. The questioning is seen as a blow to his attempts to regain the presidency of the country in the 2017 elections. Mr Sarkozy leads France's right-leaning political party, The Republicans (formerly known as UMP), and served as the president of France from 2007 to 2012. Read more: Investigations ex-French president faces Mr Sarkozy was also categorized as an "assisted witness" in relation to "allegations of using forged documents, fraud, and breach of trust," prosecutors stated. Four senior figures in Mr Sarkozy's 2012 campaign, including his campaign manager and treasurer, have previously been placed under formal investigation in relation to what has come to be known as the Bygmalion scandal. It is alleged that millions of euros in false invoices were issued by the Bygmalion PR company, which organised some of Mr Sarkozy's appearances during his campaign. Bygmalion allegedly charged 18. 5m euros (£14. 4m, $21m) to the party instead of to the Sarkozy campaign, allowing the campaign to greatly exceed the spending limit of 22. 5m euros (£17. 5m, $25m) Bygmalion is run by friends of Jean-Francois Cope, who led the UMP party for a short time between Mr Sarkozy's separate tenures. He stood down in 2014 after the allegations were made public. Mr Cope, who has been declared to be a witness in the case, also denies any knowledge of the false invoices.
The 24-year-old Englishman made only 11 starts, and seven substitute appearances, for Caley Thistle. He had joined the Scottish Premiership club from Dunfermline's Fife neighbours, Cowdenbeath, last summer. Wedderburn expressed his frustration, stating that going from consistently playing to only playing a few games and then sitting out was very irritating. The midfielder, who started his career with Stoke City and had stints with Notts County, Hereford United, Northampton Town and Corby Town, is the first signing for Pars manager Allan Johnston after the team won the League One title and earned promotion. Wedderburn helped deny Dunfermline promotion to the second tier two seasons ago with a play-off victory while with Cowdenbeath. Johnston said: "I was keen on him last year when he was at Cowdenbeath. "He can play a couple of different positions, which is going to be handy because we're going to have a small squad. "He can play in the centre of the park as a holding midfield player or he can play centre-half. " Meanwhile, Dunfermline have handed new one-year contracts to goalkeeper David Hutton and striker Lewis Spence despite the pair playing periphery roles this season. Hutton, who is 30 years old, has only made two appearances since joining from Ayr United last year, while Spence, a 20-year-old midfielder, was loaned to League One competitors Brechin City in the latter part of the season. However, Wallace, a 25-year-old striker who scored 10 goals in 41 games this season, and Byrne, a 22-year-old midfielder who played 27 times, have not received contract extensions.
Brighton and Hove City Council stated that the fee was implemented in order to address the issue of commuters utilizing Preston Park as a no-cost parking option for the entire day. The choice was made following a request with more than 2,000 signatures, citing worries about the high number of vehicles in the park. It will be charged at a rate of 50p per hour, increasing to £3 for a duration of three to six hours.
Barnardo's said it would hire 15 workers to help victims and those at risk of child sex exploitation (CSE). It comes after the Jay report found 1,400 children in Rotherham were abused by gangs of men, mainly of Pakistani origin, between 1997 and 2013. The three-year programme, funded by the government, Rotherham Council and the KPMG Foundation, will start in autumn. Council leader Chris Read said the scheme was an "innovative project". Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan said it would help teach organisations working with children in the town how to spot the signs of CSE. "We need to put in a lot of effort to ensure we do not fail the children of Rotherham, as a project like this will provide valuable support for them," he stated. "Although there are still children in Rotherham who are at risk, the same is true in all areas of the country." We think in terms of CSE we are only touching the tip of the iceberg at the moment. " Sarah Wilson, 23, was abused by a gang of men in Rotherham between the ages of 11 to 17. She has waived her right to anonymity to raise awareness of CSE and has written a book about her experiences. "I believe that CSE will never be completely eradicated, but I believe we can reduce the numbers," she said. "It is a significant challenge to address as there are more than 1,400 individuals impacted due to some not being linked to social services or law enforcement. But hopefully this money will help. " " Alexis Jay's report found children as young as 11 from the town were raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted and trafficked to other cities in England. She said there here had been "blatant" collective failures by the council's leadership in tackling the abuse and South Yorkshire Police had failed to prioritise the issue. The council is currently being run by government appointed commissioners after a separate report found it was "not fit for purpose". The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating complaints against 42 named South Yorkshire Police officers over their handling of CSE.
The dramatic late intervention gave the Tribesmen a 0-22 to 1-18 win in a keenly contested All-Ireland hurling semi-final at Croke Park on Sunday. The sides were level 13 times but Canning's 11th point of the game sent the All-Ireland champions crashing out. Galway will play the winners of next week's game between Cork and Waterford. The final will be staged on 3 September. John O'Dwyer had an opportunity to score a tying goal in the last play, but his shot from the right veered off target, securing Galway's spot in the final. Galway may have gone three matches in a row without scoring a goal, but their skill in scoring crucial points when needed carried them to victory. It's the third year in a row that the All-Ireland semi-final has been decided by a single point between theses sides, with Galway gaining revenge for last year's loss. Now they will fancy their chance of a first All-Ireland title since 1988 after surviving a thrilling conclusion. The sides were level six times in the opening half but Tipperary, playing with the breeze, led by 1-10 to 0-12 at the interval. The first goal was scored 24 minutes into the game, with John McGrath seizing on a mistake by Galway goalkeeper Colm Callanan and corner-back Adrian Tuohy to flick the ball into the net. Subs: J Flynn replaced N Burke in the 45th minute, J Glynn came on for C Mannion in the 53rd minute, S Moloney substituted C Cooney in the 70th minute, G Lally replaced McInerney from the 71st to the 73rd minute. Tipperary: D Gleeson; D Maher, J Barry, M Cahill; S Kennedy (0-01), R Maher, Paudie Maher (0-02); B Maher (0-03, 0-02f), M Breen; D McCormack, Patrick 'Bonner' Maher, N McGrath (0-02); J O'Dwyer (0-03), S Callanan (0-05, 0-03f), J McGrath (1-01) Subs: S Curtin for Patrick 'Bonner Maher (7-10), J Forde (0-01) for Breen (34), N O'Meara for Forde (62).
Kuba Oles was travelling at a minimum of 80mph (129km/h) when he hit Georgie Ann Evans' car in Dudley on 27 October. Oles, 25, who had sped down Priory Road, only suffered minor leg injuries, West Midlands Police said. Oles, from Beaconview Road, West Bromwich, admitted causing death by dangerous driving when he appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court. He was also disqualified from driving for 14 years. PC Alan Wood, who led the police inquiry, stated: "His actions behind the wheel on that day were extremely reckless and endangered other drivers on the road. "In his interviews with the police, he tried to shift the blame to Georgie, claiming she was an inexperienced driver and pulled out too slowly. It was established in court that the statement was entirely untrue and Oles was labeled as a hazardous individual who presented a substantial threat of endangering the public. Oles was also given a nine-month prison sentence, to be served at the same time, for a separate reckless driving violation that he confessed to. Ms Evans's family said in a statement: "We give our thanks to the justice system for handing down the sentence they were able to. "Unfortunately we are paying the ultimate sentence - the loss of our daughter. ".

The faulty code could potentially disable the side air bag and seat belt locking mechanism when a vehicle rolls over during a crash, the firm said. Recalled vehicles will be reprogrammed. Just over one million of the trucks were sold in the US, with thousands of others in Canada, Mexico and outside North America. The company is cognizant of one death, two injuries, and two incidents that could be linked," Fiat Chrysler said in a statement. The company also stated that an inquiry revealed the issue could be activated by a major collision. The recall is scheduled to start in late June. The affected vehicles are: Meanwhile, owners of the models have been told they can avoid the problem by turning the vehicle off and then on again if a warning light is activated due to the error.
Valued at just over Â£500m the company was being wooed by a clutch of private equity firms. But "market volatility" killed the talks. Since then Micro Focus's fortunes have changed dramatically. Last week it joined the FTSE 100 and on Thursday bought the software arm of Hewlett Packard Enterprise to become one of the UK's largest tech firms. To complete the irony, the collapse of the Micro Focus talks in 2011 coincided, almost to the day, with Hewlett-Packard's disastrous $11bn takeover of rival software group Autonomy. The remains of Autonomy, massively written down, are among the assets that Micro Focus is now buying for $8. 8bn (Â£6. Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a spin-off from HP's computer and printer business, has been acquired by Micro Focus for 6 billion dollars. This is the largest purchase on Micro Focus's list, which was created by executive chairman Kevin Loosemore. As part of the shopping spree, the Berkshire-based company has bought two other US software companies - Attachmate for $1. 2bn in 2014 and Serena Software this year for $540m. Mr Loosemore, who took the helm in 2011, said: "I contacted HPE in about February this year. We are in regular contact with most players in the mature software space, it's what we do, and HPE had just separated from HPI (Hewlett Packard Inc) at the back end of last year and I was personally intrigued as to what their new strategy was going to be. " The core of Micro Focus's business is this "mature software space", specifically linking old software technology to new. So for instance, it can make old cash machines talk to the latest banking software, or connect a supermarket's old inventory control system to the latest generation of mainframes. These businesses can be made to generate huge amounts of cash. Since 2011 Micro Focus has delivered annual compound shareholder returns of 39%. And its stated strategy is to deliver 15-20% returns to shareholders each year. That explains why Micro Focus has little problem funding its acquisitions. But its rise from mid-cap company to FTSE entrant and the near-doubling of its share price in the last year has taken many by surprise, so much so that many of the top technology analysts in London simply did not cover the stock. One analyst said: "I think many have steered clear of it because it is a complex company, a kind of portfolio business and until recently was not considered big enough. But that will all change now. " However, Paraag Amin, technology analyst from Peel Hunt, has been watching the company for almost ten years. He explained that its strategy has been to buy up software that is "mature", i. e. no longer growing and about to be superseded by new products. Software companies established in the nineties have been "evolving" in recent years, driving Micro Focus's extensive acquisition strategy and quick growth. "Micro Focus has recognized that as technologies mature and decline, they can be made more profitable by providing support and adapting them to the changing landscape." You could call them asset managers of software products. "For instance, Autonomy, which made up about 6% of HP's business will now make up over half of Micro Focus's business. But it is hoping it can take its profit margins from the 20-30% range up to 40% which is the average for Micro Focus's businesses. " Asked whether Micro Focus had the skill to hold together such a rapidly expanding group of companies, Mr Amin said: "It's exactly what they are good at, taking in declining companies, turning them round and supporting them. ".
The spent rounds, discovered by a prisoner sorting through clothing at Littlehey Prison, near Huntingdon earlier this month, were handed to a guard by the inmate. A Prison Service spokesman said: "They were quickly removed and there was no risk to the security of the prison. " An internal investigation is taking place. Littlehey Prison, in the village of Perry, houses up to 1,206 adult male sex offenders and is a category C jail. The ammunition cases were found in the pocket of a jacket in a supervised recycling workshop. A Prison Service spokesman confirmed "two empty ammunition cases were discovered in a supervised sorting area at HMP Littlehey earlier this month". The cases, which were devoid of gunpowder or firing pins, were given to workshop instructors, he stated. All prisoners are subject to a thorough search before leaving the workshop. LMB, a textile recycling company, gathers clothing from different places, such as supermarkets. Some are sent to prisons to be sorted by inmates. Last July, an imitation hand gun was found at an LMB recycling workshop at Highpoint Prison near Haverhill, Suffolk. A BB gun and a live bullet were found in a bed sheet at the same workshop in September. Recycling was halted at both Highpoint and Littlehey prisons following the discoveries but is now running again, with items being checked before being handed to inmates.
Polling stations began operating at 07:00 BST and will shut at 22:00. Electors are also casting their votes in Weymouth and Portland where a third of seats on the borough council are being contested. Across England elections are taking place for more than 120 councils and the London Assembly, and to elect  mayors in Bristol, Liverpool, London and Salford, and 36 PCCs.
The Price of Football examines the price of the least expensive and most costly match-day and season tickets, along with the price of a pie, program, cup of tea, and adult and youth replica shirts. The tool helps you navigate this information easily. Just input your club's name and all the important data will be displayed and explained for you. In addition you can work out how much support of your team is costing you. Just input the price of your ticket, expenses on food, beverages and a program, as well as the number of replica jerseys purchased and the cost of TV sports subscriptions. The calculator will then analyze this against various expenses like player salaries, transfer fees, and other recreational activities. Throughout the calculator, we compare how various costs have changed using data from previous BBC Price of Football studies. Some data comparisons are not available for clubs not included in previous years. The 'price of a goal' is calculated by dividing the cost of a club's cheapest season ticket last season by the number of goals scored by the team at home in the same season. Some comparisons are not available for clubs not surveyed last season, or promoted to the National League. Programme costs were not collected from European clubs, as many do not publish match-day programmes in the same way as UK teams. The BBC contacted 227 clubs for the study. Of those, 200 were in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales and another 27 in Europe. The data was collated and verified by BBC Sport journalists. Swansea are omitted from the survey and calculator because they declined to take part. All ticket prices refer to an adult ticket when bought individually. The match-day ticket prices quoted refer to high and low prices available on the day of a game, to reflect the price for fans who decide on match day they would like to attend a game, and not individual offers. Match-day costs reflect categories that are registered with the relevant league, rather than individual, or one-off, offers. The season ticket prices quoted refer to the cheapest possible ticket (including early bird offers), and the most expensive season ticket. Replica shirt prices are listed according to the official cost in the club shop or website - rather than separate retailers.
Four crossings will be changed from half barriers to full ones and extra track will be laid. Work is underway at crossings in Balderton, Rossett, Saltney, and Pulford that will result in certain road closures. Community meetings will be conducted, beginning on Wednesday, to engage with residents in the vicinity and talk about the upcoming work. James Jackson of Network Rail Wales said: "We are carrying out work which will allow for more frequent and faster journeys for the increasing numbers of passengers travelling between north and south Wales. I apologize for any inconvenience this work may create and appreciate the local community's patience.
Investor sentiment was also hurt by oil prices, which fell by nearly 3% after Iran put off plans to join nations proposing a freeze on production. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost more than 1% on the Bank of Japan's announcement. The index finished the session down 0. 7% to 17,117. 07 points. Earlier this year, the BOJ unexpectedly implemented negative lending rates in a bid to stimulate its struggling economy. On Tuesday, it opted to keep its lending rate unchanged and confirmed it would persist in growing the monetary base by 80 trillion yen ($700bn) annually. "The focus of [Tuesday's trading] session was the Bank of Japan, who ultimately deliveredâ€¦. very little," said Chris Weston from IG Markets. "It certainly seems that the BOJ have little desire to lower the deposit rate deeper into negative territory, in a similar vein as the European Central Bank, and from that perspective, one can make an argument that they are following the ECB's guide," he added. Japan economist Marcel Thieliant said the country's "sluggish economic activity and the stronger yen" pointed towards the need for more easing as soon as next month. "The key sentence in [the BOJ's statement] was that the bank still sees a risk that the recent volatility on global financial markets damages business confidence and halts the conversion of the deflationary mindset," he added. Mr Thieliant said the bank continued to face "considerable headwinds" in its battle to lift inflation to 2%. In other locations, Australia's key S&P/ASX 200 index dropped 1.45% and ended the day at 5,111. 40 points, weighed down by energy-related shares, which were down on the fall in oil prices. BHP Billiton's Sydney-listed shares lost 3. 45% and Woodside slid almost 4%. In afternoon trade, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0. 6% to 20,313. 29, while the Shanghai Composite was down 0. 1% to 2,856. 10. South Korea's benchmark Kospi index closed down 0. 12% to 1,969. 95.
The prisoners broke out of the jail in Nuevo Laredo late on Thursday or early on Friday morning. Security guards are being questioned on suspicion of helping the inmates flee, and prison director has gone missing. Mexico's prison system is struggling to cope with an influx of violent offenders arrested in the government's campaign against drugs cartels. Nuevo Laredo in Tamaulipas state lies just across the border from Laredo, Texas. Tamaulipas security chief Antonio Garza said the break-out - one of the largest in the country's history - went unnoticed until guards carried out a routine head count. Officials suspect that the prisoners escaped through a rear gate with the help of security guards. Mr. Garza stated that each guard is viewed as a potential accomplice in the escape, and the current location of the prison director is not known. Security forces nearby have begun a thorough search, with troops and federal police sent to secure the prison. It typically houses approximately 1,000 prisoners, a majority of whom have been found guilty of federal offenses like drug-related crimes and abduction. This marks the second large-scale prison escape in northern Mexico within the past few months. In September, 85 prisoners escaped from a jail in the nearby border city of Reynosa, also in Tamaulipas. Lawlessness is on the rise in the northern border region as cartels engage in conflict with security forces and rival cartels to dominate smuggling routes into the US. The drug cartels' propensity for violence and capability to offer substantial bribes grant them significant influence in undermining the prison system and facilitating the release of their members. In July, Mexican prosecutors accused guards at a prison in Durango state of allowing inmates to leave the jail to carry out contract killings for the cartels, and of lending them weapons and vehicles.
The main contributors are the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Union and the UK. However things have now taken a bit of a sour turn. It was recently discovered that between 2013 and 2014, Mozambique took out  loans to the tune of nearly $2bn (£1. 4bn) in order to fund various projects taken on by state-owned companies. The country has a $1bn threshold before it is required to consult its partners. In this controversial case, it seems that more debt was taken on to finance the acquisition of a large tuna factory and the remaining funds are said to have been channelled towards a contract in maritime security and some other deals involving commercial companies in which the state is a leading shareholder. The Mozambican government stood as guarantor of the loans, meaning the state would repay them if things went wrong. There have also been allegations of corruption over the deals but no-one has been arrested or charged. President Filipe Nyusi came to office 18 months ago after the debt had been acquired. He insists that his team knew nothing about this. From his sumptuous office overlooking the Maputo Bay, he told the BBC: "We also have a number of questions as to why this was not tabled to the National Assembly and correct procedures not followed. " The IMF,  World Bank and UK governments have now decided to hold back on signing further loans to Mozambique. They first want everything to be straightened out. But even this part of the story does not make much sense. After all, Mozambique is a country that has been closely monitored, even coached, by the international community for nearly a decade, following the debt relief the country received a decade ago. The programme was known as the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) through which approximately $3bn of  Mozambique's bad debts were written often off by the international community. How is it possible that foreign creditors missed the red flags? It is hard to understand how the monitoring system works. Unfortunately we have yet to ask the donor community this simple question directly. Mozambique in numbers: Population: 27 million 55% living in poverty Average annual income per person: $600 Annual economic growth 2010-14: 7. 2% Life expectancy: 55 Source: World Bank Foreign creditors are demanding greater transparency in 2016. That may be a challenge for a fairly new president whose loyalties to the governing party, Frelimo, are deep rooted. If indeed there were shenanigans in the acquisition of new debt, his political comrades may have been involved. Nonetheless President Nyusi insists that his anti-corruption drive has not been undermined by the latest scandal. Instead he says that "things are happening already even in my new cycle of government. "There are administrators from districts, there are mayors from municipalities and there senior officials from administration who have been taken to responsibility due to embezzlement of resources or corruption. " However in this saga, the names of senior officials have been mentioned and going after them would be the real test of President Nyusi's mettle. His demeanour in our interview suggests that he has little appetite for that. "There is a presumption of innocence and we cannot judge to say that so and so has done this or that," he said. It is estimated that these undisclosed loans could push up Mozambique's debt to 20% of the value of its economy. That is a heavy burden for small country to bear, especially in today's volatile markets. Also it would be too simplistic to assume that the previous government was only acting irrationally or perhaps with criminal intent. The larger global context should also be considered. Two years ago, before the global markets turned and commodity prices dropped, Mozambique was a very attractive investment destination. The debt write-off from the HIPC era gave the country a clean slate and a new balance sheet. In addition there was also the discovery of natural gas offshore, estimated to be 3 trillion cubic feet. Once tapped, the gas industry could turn Mozambique into the world's fourth largest producer. The potential for establishing a fresh economy centered on energy is immense. It is likely that some of these loans were based on an anticipated economic upturn in the near future. A case of a government counting its chickens before they hatched. President Nyusi is optimistic that Mozambique will rise above this scandal and says the economy is diverse and has a great deal to offer investors. "There is gas but gas is not edible. So we still put priority in agriculture," he says. While the emphasis is on how the donors have reacted, and what they may do, they are not the only concerned parties. Even ordinary Mozambicans have expressed concerns. Many people are feeling the pinch of rising food prices, a weaker currency and the false hope of jobs that have not materialised in the new energy and gas sectors. Civic leaders tried to launch public protests a week ago, but it has been reported that they were met by armoured vehicles and military patrols. The political agitation is not only centred on these latest concerns, there are growing tensions between the government and opposition Renamo party in the north and central regions. Armed groups loyal to Renamo, a former rebel group, have begun an insurgency. There are frequent skirmishes and aid agencies say that 4,000 people have fled the country becoming refugees in neighbouring Malawi. The president maintains that despite the news reports, there is no civil war in Mozambique. The government has no desire for conflict. "We are merely defending our people against an armed political party. We are defending our democracy. " But as he defends Mozambique's democracy, he will also need to defend the honour of his administration and Frelimo. The first thing will be to prove that his government is committed to transparency and accountability.
University College London (UCL) said Sir Tim Hunt - a Royal Society fellow -  had resigned from his position within its faculty of life sciences. He told a conference that women in labs "cry" when criticised and "fall in love" with male counterparts. He told the BBC he "did mean" the remarks but was "really sorry". A statement from the university read: "UCL can confirm that Sir Tim Hunt FRS has resigned from his position as honorary professor with the UCL faculty of life sciences following comments he made about women in science at the World Conference of Science Journalists on 9 June. "UCL was the first university in England to admit women students on equal terms to men, and the university believes that this outcome is compatible with our commitment to gender equality. " Sir Tim, 72 - who was awarded the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 2001 for his work on how cells divide - reportedly told the conference in South Korea: "Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. "Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry. " Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday, Sir Tim said he was "really sorry that I said what I said", adding it was "a very stupid thing to do in the presence of all those journalists". The British biochemist, who was knighted in 2006, stated that his comments at a conference in South Korea were meant to be light-hearted and ironic, but were taken very seriously by his audience. He continued to affirm that he stands by some of the remarks. "I did mean the part about having trouble with girls," he said. I have developed romantic feelings for individuals in the lab, and they have reciprocated those feelings, causing disruption to the scientific environment. It is crucial for everyone in a lab to be on equal footing, and these emotional connections have made daily life challenging. "I'm really, really sorry I caused any offence, that's awful. I certainly didn't mean that. I just meant to be honest, actually. " Female scientists post 'distractingly sexy' photos Viewpoint: Women must fight sexism in science Imran Khan, chief executive of the British Science Association, said the comments were "frustrating". "Sadly, dealing with sexism and other forms of discrimination are a daily reality for many people, and I imagine it's hard to find Sir Tim's comments funny if you've been held back by systemic bias for years - whether those remarks were intended as a joke or not," he said. Aoife McLysaght, professor in genetics at Trinity College Dublin, told the BBC: "It's very unsatisfactory when someone apologises for causing offence rather than for the view they hold. " Prof McLysaght also said: "If he has trouble controlling emotions around women, he should work on controlling his emotions rather than suggest that labs are segregated. " Emily Rice, an astrophysics professor at the College of Staten Island in New York, said she had been "fairy lucky" in her career. But she added sexist attitudes were "ingrained". Prof Rice stated that while individuals are adept at being objective, rational, and logical when dealing with data, they often struggle to apply the same qualities when evaluating themselves.
The people, whose ages ranged from 17 to 46, were scheduled to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court. A total of 70 arrests have been made after a pitch invasion at Hampden on Saturday 21 May, leading to violent altercations. The disorder marred the end of the Hibs v Rangers clash, which ended in a 3-2 victory for the Edinburgh side.
More than 500,000 people have signed the parliamentary e-petition. In response, the government said it recognised the strength of feeling against Mr Trump's comments, which are expected to be debated by MPs. Ministers previously criticised his remarks but disagreed with banning him. Any petition that exceeds 10,000 signatures on the parliament website will receive a response from the government. If a petition reaches over 100,000 signatures, it will be automatically reviewed for discussion in Parliament. The bipartisan Commons petitions committee will convene next week to determine if a parliamentary debate should be held regarding the petition to prohibit Mr. Trump. There is an assumption that it will be discussed due to the number of signatures. The government replied that it does not provide remarks on specific immigration and exclusion determinations. The home secretary has the authority to ban a non-European Economic Area national from entering the UK if she deems their presence to be against the public good. Theresa May has stated that coming to the UK is a privilege, not a right. Exclusion powers are taken very seriously and are only used after considering all available evidence. The government acknowledges the strong opposition to the comments and will continue to denounce remarks that have the potential to divide communities, regardless of the source. "We reject any attempts to create division and marginalisation amongst those we endeavour to protect. " Prime Minister David Cameron has labelled Mr Trump's comments "stupid" but said he did not support a ban, telling MPs the tycoon would "unite us all against him" if he visited the UK.
Is South Africa ready for mixed-race love? Born free in South Africa Your pictures Working Lives South Africa Direct But their business acumen has not always been welcomed at first by local people, as Kharul Islam, a slightly built Bangladeshi in his mid-20s, can affirm. He runs a small grocery shop, known in South Africa as a spaza, in the crime-ridden area of Delft, about 30km (19 miles) east of Cape Town. With its red painted exterior, the Comic Grocer is easy to spot from a distance; look closer and you notice the bullet-proof glass and the metal mesh guards "I've had to put in bullet-proof glass to protect me. When I first came people threatened to kill me," he says. It was local criminals who tried to intimidate him when he moved in three years ago. Last year alone, the area recorded 113 murders, 129 cases of attempted murder and nearly 1,500 cases of violent crime in 2013, according to police statistics. "But now that they know me it's better and safer," he says. His customers come in to buy single items like a roll of toilet paper, sugar, milk or bread, but it is clear that the Bangladeshi, who has a Tanzanian and Zimbabwean to assist him, has developed a good relationship with them. Operating in an economically depressed area like Delft, with a 43% rate of unemployment, the foreign shop owners have adapted their products to meet the needs of their customers. Like many foreign traders, Mr Islam sells small quantities of essentials like tea, coffee, sugar and flour. "People don't have money to buy the pre-packed quantities provided by the suppliers so I make it easier and more affordable for them. I give them what they need. " Following the advent of democracy in South Africa in 1994, it was initially Somalis, fleeing their country's civil strife, who made inroads into the townships. South Africa votes 2014 Using their renowned trading skills, they established themselves in the spaza market, often to the displeasure of local traders who saw their share of this business sector cut back. The past five years has seen a new wave of traders from mainly Bangladesh - and to a lesser extent countries like Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia - trying to squeeze into what has become an increasingly competitive market. The Spaza News industry newsletter says South Africa's spaza sector comprises more than 100,000 enterprises with a collective annual turnover of 7bn rand (about $663m; £395m). Eight urban sites studied between 2010 and 2013 showed that nearly 50% of spaza shops were operated by foreign entrepreneurs, according to researchers at the University of Western Cape's Political Science Department and the non-profit organisation Sustainable Livelihoods Foundation. Most of the foreigners work a punishing 16-hour day, seven days a week, and most have a mattress and washing facilities in a modestly furnished room attached to the shop. Not surprisingly, local shop owners have complained about the influx of foreign competitors who they say have impacted on their trade. Evelyn Domingo, who runs her spaza shop not far from Mr Islam's, says her business has suffered over the past two years. "I'm not happy; business has been slow since the foreigners started opening up. They are able to keep their prices down because they group together which enables them to buy at lower prices," she says. "It's only the lotto [national lottery] tickets that attract people to my shop because it's only me and the post office down the road that sells the tickets. " Tune in to the BBC World Service at 1900 GMT on Friday to listen to the BBC Africa Debate: South Africa Decides - Has Democracy Delivered? You can also take part on Twitter - using #bbcafricadebate - Facebook or Google+ Africa Debate Ms Domingo, whose husband was killed in a robbery two years ago, says the government promised to do something to help local traders, but has failed to do so. While many of the foreigners, especially the closely knit Somali community, have managed to secure cheaper prices from wholesalers by buying in bulk, the influx of migrant traders has also provided business opportunities for local entrepreneurs like Mujeeb Rockman. He has been supplying items like washing powder, toilet paper, sweets and cool drinks for the past year to small shops in the townships. "The majority of locals are selling their shops off to foreigners or renting the buildings out to them," he says. "The number of foreign-run shops has increased dramatically which is not a bad thing because they are good business people; they like to bargain for a better price. "What also helps is that they don't have extravagant lifestyles, so they are able to cope with smaller profit margins because they are able to live with less. " The success of the foreign business people in the townships has made them an easy target for local criminals, allegedly backed in some cases, orchestrated campaigns by envious local spaza owners. Whenever there is a protest about the lack of basic amenities - a fairly frequent occurrence in townships - the foreign-owned businesses are often among the first to be targeted by opportunists within the community who loot their shops. But things are changing, as three men convicted of killing and robbing a Somali trader and injuring two of his compatriots last year received jail sentences of 25 and 30 years. "We have tried to change the perception that we are easy targets. We are also working closely with the police," says Mohamed Aden, spokesperson for the Somali Association of South Africa. Mr Islam's brother-in-law, Altaafur Rhaman, also operates a spaza in Delft, although it is a smaller establishment. Securely protected by a sturdy mesh steel safety gate, which has a small opening for transactions, Mr Rhaman understands the risks of doing business in Delft. "It's dangerous here, many of my friends have been robbed and there are many poor people here, but it's OK, I'm able to make a living," he says. "I try to be friendly and to help where I can. " Mr Rhaman has tried to win over the residents in his immediate vicinity. He says he is trying to learn the local languages - Afrikaans and Xhosa - and also tries to understand the needs of the economically depressed community. "I like to buy from him, he's very nice," says a young woman who has come to buy eggs. Another customer, a neat young man in jeans and a fashionable baseball cap, agrees: "I like them [the Bangladeshis], not everything is cheaper than at the locally owned shops but it's a pleasure to buy from them.

The Grade II listed City Pool and Turkish Baths in Newcastle shut in 2013 due to the "high investment" needed. Fusion Lifestyle Ltd has been given permission to lease the site and intends to refurbish the premises and bring back the historical baths. The Re-open Newcastle Turkish Baths campaign group expressed their happiness at the announcement. The building, which became operational on Northumberland Road in 1928, is one of just 11 similar facilities in England. Cait Read, a member of the group, expressed enthusiasm for continuing to be part of the building's future, guaranteeing its reopening as a beneficial asset for Newcastle residents and a draw for city visitors. " Fusion has also taken over the City Hall, which was under threat of closure as part of a consultation into multi-million pound budget cuts in the city. The Newcastle Theatre Royal Trust will sub-lease the City Hall and maintain its use as a concert and entertainment venue. City Hall Action group chairman Tony Stephenson expressed his satisfaction with the deal, stating that it ensures the venue will remain a viable music venue in the future. ".
Two men were left in hospital after they were assaulted in Bath Street at about 03:30 on Saturday 26 September. They had been involved in an argument with a group of people and were seriously injured in an ensuing fight. Police appealed for any witnesses who recognise the men in the images issued to come forward. The first man is described as being white, 20 to 25 years old, 5ft 10in to 6ft tall and with short hair. He had on a long-sleeved polo shirt and jeans in a dark color. The other man, who was about the same age, stood at a height of 6ft to 6ft 2in and had dark hair. He had on a polo top in a dark hue. Det Con Blair Duncan, from Police Scotland, mentioned that Bath Street was crowded during the event, and asked for anyone who helped the victims or witnessed the suspects to get in touch with the authorities.
Traffic lights and bus stops were pollution hotspots and there were higher levels of pollution in the morning compared with the afternoon, the University of Surrey study said. Young children are more at risk because their bodies are small and developing. And they may be inhaling harmful substances, according to the study. A recent report from the World Health Organization revealed that 570,000 children under five years old die each year from diseases that may be associated with pollution. The Surrey research, published in Environmental Pollution, was based on measurements from air monitoring equipment inside toddlers' prams being pushed to and from schools during drop-off and pick-up times. Researchers examined pollution levels inside strollers during 64 journeys totaling approximately 50 miles (80km) in Guildford. Bus stops and traffic lights were pinpointed as the most troublesome spots for being exposed to tiny particles from vehicle exhaust and tires that could potentially make their way into the bloodstream. Additionally, these harmful particles were found to be more prevalent in the air during morning drop-off times, when traffic was at its peak. Dr Prashant Kumar, lead study author from the University of Surrey, said his findings were a warning to parents. "Children are much more vulnerable to pollution than adults because of their developing systems and lower body weight," he stated. "Basically, children may be exposed to inhaling harmful chemical compounds like iron, aluminum, and silica that combine to form particles of different sizes." " Dr Kumar said the best way to stop this happening was to use a barrier between children in prams and the emissions from vehicle exhausts, especially at traffic lights, crossroads and bus stops. He said his research team was also trying to find a way to clean the air around children sitting in their prams.
The 38-year-old confessed "immediately" following his arrest, French prosecutor Jean-Pierre Valensi said. The girl, named locally as Chloe, was found dead in woodland on Wednesday after being raped and strangled. Thousands of people, including her mother, marched through Calais on Thursday in her memory. Chloe was playing with a friend near her home, when she approached the man at about 15:30 local time (13:30 GMT) on Wednesday and sprayed him with a water pistol. The girl's mother informed French broadcaster BFMTV that she had briefly left her daughter unattended for five minutes while she attended to her two younger children. When she returned, she witnessed the assailant abducting her daughter and forcing her into a vehicle. Less than two hours later, the girl's body was found in a nearby wooded area. The suspect, who was under the influence of alcohol, was found close to the crime scene. Forensic experts found indications of "choking and sexual assault", according to Mr. Valensi. The individual has a record of violent crimes and has been incarcerated in both France and Poland. He was reportedly released just months ago after serving a six-year sentence. One of his victims, a 78-year-old woman, told France's Le Parisien newspaper police had promised her he had been expelled to Poland. Mr Valensi said the suspect had arrived back in France on Wednesday morning and was planning to travel to England to visit his sister. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for a full investigation in to the man's past, saying Chloe's family deserved the "whole truth".
Odion Ighalo put the hosts in front from close range, only for Antonio to level with a solo effort moments later. Matej Vydra restored the Hornets' lead from the spot after he was brought down by Kelvin Wilson. But Antonio levelled again, heading in Chris Burke's cross to leave new Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic with four points from his first two games. Media playback is not supported on this device Watford are now on an unbeaten run of seven games, which has been overseen by three different head coaches, with Oscar Garcia leaving at the end of September and his replacement Billy McKinlay making way for Jokanovic two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Stuart Pearce's Forest have fallen away from the top two to sixth, with their last league victory coming at home to Fulham on 17 September, and they started slowly as Fernando Forestieri and Vydra both forced saves from Karl Darlow. A David Vaughan free-kick that was deflected narrowly wide was Forest's only response before Ighalo had the Hornets in front - and his third goal in his last three games - by poking in Gianni Munari's superb back-flick from Almen Abdi's cross. Media playback is not supported on this device The lead lasted just two minutes though, as Abdi gave the ball away to Antonio who strode forward and finished from a tight angle, before Michael Mancienne seemed to be fortunate to get just a booking for bringing down Vydra when he was through on goal. Shortly after the break Vydra was brought down by Wilson and the Czech calmly rolled in from 12 yards to restore the lead. And the Hornets looked relatively comfortable afterwards, moving the ball around with confidence, until Burke did well to find space down the right and swung in a hanging cross that Antonio powered in at the back post for his eighth of the season. Vydra's shot straight at Darlow was as close as Watford came to a late winner, and they drop down to second after Derby's win at Blackpool. Watford head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: "I think we played very well in the first 60 minutes. The last 30 minutes we lost a bit of tactical order and tried to win the game with hearts and not minds. "For me [the Mancienne foul] was 100% a sending off. It's the same with the penalty. For me both situations are sendings off. " Forest assistant manager Steve Wigley: "It was a good point. We knew we were coming to a team that was in the best form they've been in this season. "We knew we would have to play well and resolute is a good word to describe us. We showed a lot of character. We more than deserved a point. "Karl Darlow put in a good performance and away from home your keeper is going to have to play well. " On Mancienne's foul on Vydra: "Your heart is in your mouth when something like that happens. We're at ground level so can't see if somebody is coming around. One ref will give you a yellow, another a red. But I was delighted it was yellow. " Match ends, Watford 2, Nottingham Forest 2. Second Half ends, Watford 2, Nottingham Forest 2.

Rowntree served as forwards coach during the successful 2-1 Test series against Australia in 2013, and will be part of Warren Gatland's team this summer alongside Steve Borthwick, Andy Farrell, and Rob Howley. This means that the team from four years ago has been brought back together, with the addition of England forwards coach Borthwick. It is understood Harlequins have agreed to release Rowntree for Lions duty. The 45-year-old former prop toured with the Lions in 1997 and 2005 and spent eight years as England's forwards and scrum coach before leaving in 2015. Borthwick worked with Eddie Jones during Japan's 2015 World Cup campaign before joining the Australian's England staff, and Ireland defence coach Farrell was one of Gatland's assistants four years ago. Howley, who acted as temporary coach for Wales, was also part of the coaching team during that tour and the 2009 series in South Africa, where the Lions were defeated 2-1. 3 June - Provincial union team (Toll Stadium, Whangarei) 7 June - Blues (Eden Park, Auckland) 10 June - Crusaders (AMI Stadium, Christchurch) 13 June - Highlanders (Forsyth Barr Stadium, Dunedin) 17 June - Maori (International Stadium, Rotorua) 20 June - Chiefs (Waikato Stadium, Hamilton) 24 June - New Zealand (First Test, Eden Park, Auckland) 27 June - Hurricanes (Westpac Stadium, Wellington) 1 July - New Zealand (Second Test, Westpac Stadium, Wellington) 8 July - New Zealand (Third Test, Eden Park, Auckland)
A former member of the Libor compilation team at Thomson Reuters says it regularly warned senior BBA staff about the problem. Its reports regularly highlighted the implausible rate submissions of several banks involved in the Libor process. The BBA denied these had amounted to warnings of wrong-doing. Each day the six-man team at Thomson Reuters would calculate the various Libor interest rates, based on estimates submitted by staff from a panel of banks about how much it would cost them to borrow in the financial markets, in various currencies and for various durations. The most extreme estimates were removed as anomalies and the mean rate was calculated from the rest before being released. The cautionary alerts from the Libor group were forwarded to John Ewan, the BBA's Libor chief, who is currently employed by Thomson Reuters. The former member of the rate-compilation team - who wishes to remain anonymous - told the BBC that Mr Ewan was given weekly reports, detailing the oddities. "He [John Ewan] was the watch-keeper at the time," the rate-compiler said, "we would tell him of our concerns. " The rate-compiler explained the process. The individual mentioned that details of these unusual occurrences would be sent in a report to the BBA at the end of each week. Periodically, a more comprehensive report would be submitted to the BBA, indicating that there are issues with certain banks, the rate-compiler included. Mr Ewan told the Libor team he would look into the repeated evidence of unusual Libor submissions, which were coming increasingly frequently from several banks. "I wouldn't say he took no action," the Libor rate-compiler assured the BBC. "He took notice of them. Action was taken. But the BBA was not very effectual at the time. " The team where the rate-compiler worked was contracted by the BBA to calculate the Libor rates each day on its behalf. At the height of the financial crisis in 2008 the authorities in the UK and the USA became worried that the daily Libor-setting process was becoming meaningless. The banks were having great trouble borrowing money in the wholesale financial markets. Last month the rate-fixing scandal became public when Barclays was fined Â£290m by the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic. This was party due to toning down its Libor submissions in 2007 and 2008 to avoid giving the impression it was in financial stress and having to pay higher rates than its rivals to borrow funds. The member of the Libor compilation team told the BBC that, for six months in 2008, it became very obvious that something fishy was going on. "Definitely, it was a daily thing," the former employee said. "For three-month Libor, one bank might say 4. 5%, Barclays 5%, UBS 3. 5%. " "We would ask 'what's all that about?' and phone them up," the compiler said. The process of checking the implausible rates even threatened to disrupt the normal publication of the Libor data, with the normal 11:00am deadline slipping to as late as midday. "You would see the publication times getting later and later," the rate-setter said. "We would get calls from half eleven onwards [from bank dealing rooms] asking 'where are the rates?" The former employee told the BBC that the suspicious rate submissions to the Thomson Reuters team became particularly obvious after the collapse of the US investment bank Bear Stearns in March 2008, which had to be bailed out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "After that all bets were off," the Libor rate-compiler said. "You'd be making calls for half an hour each day, saying 'you've quoted this, other banks are higher, do you want to revise your rate?" "A number of banks were quoting wildly differently," the person pointed out. The rate-compiler said it became obvious to quite a few money-market traders that something was fishy, because the team would receive calls from traders querying the quotes submitted by other banks. "It is not possible to hide what was happening," the compiler said. "I think all the guys who were contributing on a daily basis and involved in the trades would have known. "They would have been saying: 'He's quoting nonsense, why should I be quoting a real rate if he is quoting nonsense?" the rate-compiler explained. And how many people in bank dealing rooms would have been aware of all this? "Across 16 banks you've got to be looking at 150 to 160 people [maybe] half that were involved in day to day trading and querying [other banks quoted rates]," the person said. So far all the public scrutiny has been of Barclays, which became the first bank to confess its role and be punished. With international investigations continuing into other banks, the former Libor rate-compiler confirmed that the authorities are on the right track. The person told the BBC that about four or five banks seemed to be consistently submitting suspicious rate estimates. "Other individual banks were at it. A good half were playing the game [by the rules], the others were doing false submissions," the compiler said. "[A foreign bank] was the one we were most concerned about. "Barclays is the first of many - where are the rest of them?" the person asked. The former rate-compiler is most amazed by the fact that it has taken four years for the issue to come to light. "I can't comprehend why it has taken this long," the individual stated. "If they sat half a dozen ex-traders together in a room, I am sure within 20-30 minutes you would get all the dark secrets. " In response to these points, the BBA acknowledged that it had been told of some misgivings by the Libor team. "As part of the process Thomson Reuters queries rates which fall outside normal tolerances," said a BBA spokeswoman. "In 2008 reports from Thomson Reuters were submitted to the independent foreign exchange and money market (FX&MM) committee which was then able to request further information from submitting banks. The BBA did not have knowledge of rates being manipulated, but due to the bigger context suggesting a dysfunctional market - including Thomson Reuters' reports - the BBA initiated a consultation in 2008. In 2008, the BBA began reviewing the Libor-setting process, which was later found by the Bank of England to be inadequate. According to the rate-compiler working on the Libor team, the BBA appeared to be unaware of the situation. "I think the BBA was totally ineffectual," the former employee said. "It should have known what was happening and should have been jumping up and down. "No-one was standing up and saying 'this is wrong'," the rate-compiler added.
Council leader Mohammed Pervez issued a caution as the council unveiled its budget plans for 2015/16. He attributed the expected cuts to decreases in central government funding and stated that Stoke was among the councils most severely impacted in the nation. Unite, which represents about 600 workers at the council, said it was "a terrible state to be in". "Our members will now have a fairly bleak Christmas wondering if they will have a job in the future," said regional secretary Gerard Coyne. "It's hard to see how this can take place without services and the quality of them being affected. " The city council, which expects government funding to fall by £15. 3m next year, has stated there will be a "fundamental redesign" of business support services and "accelerated work" to transform adult social care. It said there would be a rethink about how services like waste collection and street cleaning operate. About 1,800 staff have already left the council in the past four years. Mr Pervez said: "While we have done everything that we can to effectively deliver a balanced budget and invest in the city, we inevitably have to take tough decisions. " The council tax allocation will be frozen if the budget is agreed. An extra £2. Children's social care will receive a £1m investment, while an extra £2m will be allocated to learning disabilities services. The council has announced plans to enhance road access to Etruria Valley and establish a new library at Smithfield. A new retirement village for over 55s would also be finished new financial year. Local Government Minister Kris Hopkins said Stoke's spending had increased since the coalition took power. "Every bit of the public sector needs to do their bit to pay off the deficit left by the last administration including local government which accounts for a quarter of all public spending," he said. Consultation is taking place and the budget will be decided on 26 February.
The Latics will be his third team in as many years after joining from Blackpool two seasons ago. His career began at Morecambe and he has also had spells at Rochdale, Colchester, Chesterfield, Stockport, and Barnsley. "Every squad needs its senior players and David is one of those players every club needs," said boss Paul Cook.
Gwent Police said it was "extremely concerned" after five incidents potentially linked to heroin were reported between 23 October and Friday. They happened in Caerphilly, Newport and Blaenau Gwent. Det Insp Leigh Mears said he "cannot rule out the possibility that the deaths and the medical emergencies are linked to the same batch of heroin". He added: "The use of heroin is of course illegal, but I would urge anyone using the drug to be especially cautious and vigilant. If they encounter any abnormal symptoms following drug consumption, they should promptly seek medical assistance.
Robinson, the son of former Bristol coach Andy, arrived from Championship side Moseley in April 2014. The 25-year-old has scored 31 tries in 51 outings for the team, featuring in 10 Premiership matches this campaign. Ollie Dawe, a 19-year-old prop representing England under-20s, has committed to a new deal with Bristol. Head coach Mark Tainton has voiced his pleasure with the players' dedication to Bristol Rugby. " "Olly [Robinson] has proven himself as a top flight performer, while Ollie [Dawe] is showing great progress with the academy. ".
It said it handled a total of 1,606,168 travellers during 2016, an increase of 154,375 passengers on the 2015 total of 1,451,792 passengers - a rise of 10. 6%. Hial runs locations in the Highlands, Western Isles, Orkney, Shetland, Argyll, and Dundee Airport. Inverness Airport is among the most active of its 11 airports. Inverness was able to reach a total of 796,854 passengers in 2016, which was an increase of 118,171 compared to the previous year, due to its connections to airports in London and continental Europe. Hial noted a decline in passenger numbers at Wick John O'Groats and Stornoway in Lewis, attributed to reduced demand for energy sector services to and from Aberdeen. Campbeltown saw a slight decline in annual passenger numbers of 1. 1%. Inglis Lyon, the managing director of Hial, expressed his joy in the increasing overall passenger numbers. This shows the importance of their services to the communities they serve and indicates a high demand for increased connectivity to and from the Highlands and Islands. "Our regional airports have a key role to play in strengthening Scotland's economy and offering great choice for leisure and business passengers. " He added: "We will continue to invest in our airports, work in partnership with the airlines and destination airports, and further develop our customer service as we attract new business and look to cement our growth in the future. ".
Gervais Dylan Gatete, 21, of Raleigh, North Carolina, was with seven other people when the incident happened. Just before midnight on Tuesday the group flagged down park rangers who helped transport Mr Gatete to hospital. This is the first incident near the famous hot springs this year. Last June a man died after falling into a spring. Mr Gatete, who is a hotel employee in the park, was flown from the airport in West Yellowstone to Salt Lake City, where he is in stable condition in hospital. Yellowstone Superintendent Dan Wenk emphasized in a statement that the park's thermal features are hazardous, and the ground nearby is delicate and shallow, with scorching water just below the surface. "We continuously remind visitors to stay on designated paths and boardwalks in geyser basins, not only to preserve the environment, but also for their own safety," he said. Some Yellowstone geothermal spring temperatures can get as high as 199F degrees (93C). In 2016, a 23-year-old man passed away in the Lower Geyser Basin after straying from the designated boardwalk path with his sister. Authorities later determined it was too unsafe to recover his body, which had dissolved almost entirely by the following day. The area of the park where the hot springs and geysers - which spout water into the air - are located is on the edge of the famous Yellowstone caldera, a "supervolcano" or "hotspot". The caldera's activity fuels the thermal pools in the area.
The document, published by a French newspaper, is said to contain advice by the head of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Abdel Malek Droukdel. It criticises militants in Mali for implementing Islamic law too quickly and predicts France's intervention. The document was found by journalists in Timbuktu, northern Mali. Bin Laden advised Somali militants on 'good governance' The advice and instructions, said to be given by the Algerian Mr Droukdel, revealed in the Liberation paper, are dated 20 July 2012 - four months after a loose coalition of al-Qaeda-affiliated groups and ethnic Tuareg fighters took control of northern Mali. In the document, versions of which were earlier published by Associated Press news agency and French radio station RFI, Mr Droukdel warns his subordinates not to implement Islamic law too quickly. This advice, he said, was because the jihadist project in Mali is "a baby in its first days that is still crawling". The highly unusual document is written almost in the style of a chief executive officer issuing instructions to his middle management. The AQIM leader criticises his subordinates for allowing Islamists to destroy shrines they considered "idolatrous". This destruction was one of the acts which drew the attention of the outside world to northern Mali. Mali crisis: Key players Mr Droukdel also predicts a Western military intervention against the Islamist project in Mali. He was correct, of course; French forces led the expulsion of the Islamists from Mali's main towns earlier this year. The critique of lower-ranking members within the Islamist movement by Mr. Droukdel suggests that he believes some of the factions in northern Mali were impulsive and needed to be controlled in order to pursue a more cautious approach towards achieving the goal of a jihadist state. If this "hothead theory" is correct, it may help explain the apparently irrational military advance that the Islamists made towards the Malian capital, Bamako, in early January. Experienced Mali-watchers were perplexed by the sudden military lurch southwards made by the Malian Islamist groups, Ansar Dine and Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (Mujao), which prompted the French response. These observers said it was most unlikely the Islamists could ever control the whole of Mali - and that they should have been aware of this. The Mali-watchers pointed out that while northern Mali is sparsely populated and contains some groups sympathetic with Islamists or the ethnic Tuaregs, the same cannot be said of the south, where most people oppose the radicals and separatists. It therefore seemed irrational when these groups advanced in early January on the north-eastern town of Konna, which is within striking distance of a major military airbase at Sevare, near the city of Mopti. The threat to the Severe airbase, the biggest in central Mali, appears to have been what made the French move - and defeat the Islamists, so far, in the main towns and cities of the north. It is possible that there were other factors leading to the war between the French and the Islamists. However, the theory of hotheadedness seems to be supported by the instructions and advice from Droukdel. Mr. Droukdel refers to the document as "a series of guidelines and suggestions. for the fellow emirs in the Sahara". It essentially recommends exercising caution to prevent a likely, possibly definite military intervention by Western powers "who still have a lot of options available". The leader of AQIM cautions his immediate followers to avoid being in the "forefront". It is believed that a number of the high-ranking members of AQIM are Algerian. Mr Droukdel says the strategy should be, rather, to include local Malian activists to share both the management of the jihad and any possible blame if the West intervenes and failure ensues. "The aim of building these bridges," Mr Droukdel says, "is to make it so that our Mujahedeen are no longer isolated in society, and to integrate with the different factions, including the big tribes and main rebel movements and tribal chiefs". The aim of the manifesto is clearly jihadist. But the tone is tactical and managerial - in contrast to the passionate, extremist image sometimes attributed in the West to the Islamists. In the document Mr Droukdel strongly criticises "wrong policies" and "the extreme speed with which you applied Sharia [Islamic law]". He writes about two major mistakes "which I hope you will not repeat: The tone of the document implies that a rational, long-term planning mechanism is in place. One implication of this is that while the French military may have scored impressive short term success, AQIM and its allies will almost certainly be back to try to re-implement the plan at a later date.
Media playback is not supported on this device Lizzy Yarnold's skeleton gold, silver for the men's curlers, bronze for the women's curlers and Jenny Jones in snowboard slopestyle equalled the record of four medals Great Britain won at the inaugural Winter Olympics in Chamonix 1924. UK Sport invested £13. 4m from lottery and exchequer funding to achieve their goal, but could have earned more podium places. Elise Christie's three disqualifications in short track were a bitter pill to swallow, highly-rated slopestyle skier James Woods was hampered by a hip injury in training and John Jackson's GBR 1 bobsleigh crew led briefly on a tense final afternoon in the Sochi sun. Olympic sport is decided by fine margins - there are winners, losers and those in between. Four years of toil is done. The journey to Pyeongchang starts at this moment. No UK Sport funding was provided for Sochi, resulting in zero medals. Soldiers Lee Jackson and Amanda Lightfoot competed for Great Britain in biathlon but placed outside the top 40 in their events. In cross country, Britain had four athletes competing with a best finish of 29th in the sprint free by Andrew Musgrave, who recently won the Norwegian national championships. The 23-year-old was 44th in the 15km classic and 53rd in the 50km mass start, but did not finish the team sprint classic after team-mate Andrew Young suffered from a flare up of a pre-existing heart condition. Others: Jackson (33) - 67th in 10km sprint, 42nd in 20km individual; Lightfoot (27) - 71st in 15km individual, 75th in 7. 5km sprint. Young (22) - 42nd sprint free, 37th in 15km classic; Callum Smith (21) - 67th in 15km classic, 62nd 15km + 15km skiathlon, 62nd sprint free; Rosamund Musgrave (27) - 66th in 10km classic, 42nd in sprint free. BBC commentator Rob Walker said: "Andrew Musgrave will be pretty disappointed. He came last in his sprint free quarter, and he'll be wishing that worked out differently. It was still the best performance ever by a Briton in cross country (Tom Cairney was 28th out of 30 in 1956) so he is making inroads, albeit slowly, in what is a very competitive field. "Overall, the fact Britain had four cross-country skiers was absolutely tremendous. Vancouver was first time Britain even had any cross-country skiers since 1994. Hopefully people at home have seen the sport a bit and it's perked the interest. "The biathlon was OK, but they need a bit more financial support. They are heavily reliant on army people at the moment. " Funding to Sochi: £3,304,250 Previous Olympic success: Gold: 1964 (two-man), silver: 1924 (four-man), bronze: 1936 and 1998 (four-man). Performance target: 0-1 medal (or 1x 4th-6th for men; 1x 4th-8th for women) Medals in Sochi: 0 GBR 1 pilot John Jackson steered his four-man team into the lead at one stage midway through the fourth run but the remaining crews nudged them down to fifth at the Sanki Sliding Centre. We listen to music, we eat as much as possible and slap each other in the face Jackson, who defied doctors by fighting back from a serious Achilles injury, drove his crew of Joel Fearon, Stuart Benson and Bruce Tasker to within 0. 11s of an Olympic medal. The quartet, who came to Sochi as European silver medallists, achieved their Games target of a top-six finish. Lamin Deen's GBR2 four-man squad narrowly qualified for the top-20 to contest the final run and ended 19th. Britain's women's crew of Paula Walker and Rebekah Wilson finished 12th, while Deen and John Baines in the two-man bob came 23rd. The team only came together the week before competition started after a back injury in training ruled out Beijing Olympic sprinter Craig Pickering. Former Olympic brakeman and BBC commentator Colin Bryce said: "Paula Walker didn't get on with the track initially and struggled in training, but she stepped it up in competition and although she was not in the top eight as she hoped, I still think it was a solid result. "Lamin Deen is a pilot for the future. He's a big strong man, improved over the season, especially in the four-man, and bodes well for the future. "John Jackson and his crew pushed exceptional starts. The athletes they brought into the crew, and the technological help from McLaren and BAE Systems, gave him the chance to drive as well as he did, despite the horrific injury. A good pilot, a good beginning, and good equipment are necessary for success, and GBR 1 had exceptional examples of all three. Hopefully, Jackson will continue in the sport for a few more seasons to earn more well-deserved medals. " Previous Olympic success: Gold: 1924 (men) and 2002 (women) UK Sport funding to Sochi: £2,055,100 Performance target: 1-2 medals Medals in Sochi: 2 (one silver, one bronze) Media playback is not supported on this device Britain's curlers once again captivated the nation with their ancient and absorbing game. And in winning two medals they achieved at the top end of their performance target, proving the British curling machine is working. David Murdoch's men beat world champions Sweden to reach the final but went down 9-3 to defending champions Canada in the gold-medal match. "We just never got off to a good start," said Murdoch. "A silver medal is scarily cool. " Eve Muirhead's women lost to Canada in the semi-final but beat Switzerland 6-5 with the last stone of the match to claim bronze. "It's a dream come true," said Muirhead. "This is the medal we've been missing and to win it with four of my best friends feels so special. " Former Olympic curler and BBC commentator Jackie Lockhart said: "We've hit our targets, won a silver and a bronze and raised the profile of our sport. It's onwards and upwards from here. " Previous Olympic success: Gold: Jayne Torvill & Christopher Dean (1984), Robin Cousins (1980), John Curry (1976), Jeannette Altwegg (1952), silver: Cecilia Colledge (1936), bronze: Torvill & Dean (1994), Altwegg (1948) and Ethel Muckelt (1924). UK Sport funding to Sochi: £174,338 Performance target: Top-10 Medals in Sochi: 0 Britain's six skaters competed in the team event first and placed a not wholly unexpected 10th and last, with only the top five going through to the free programme. Media playback is not supported on this device In the ice dance, Penny Coomes and Nick Buckland - the latter skating less than four months after undergoing heart surgery - met their top-10 target with 10th overall. The GB pair of David King, 29, and Stacey Kemp, 23, finished 19th out of 20 in the short programme and so also fell short of qualification for the free skate. Jenna McCorkell, 27, fell one place short of qualification for the free skating after finishing 25th in the short programme. BBC figure skating commentator Sue Barker said: "Penny and Nick had a really traumatic first week when they were penalised by the judge in the short programme twice, mainly for an extended lift which they didn't get right, which was heart breaking for them. "They bounced back with a fabulous free dance that gives them a lot of confidence going forward. The 2018 Winter Games were always their goal and they have learned some harsh but valuable lessons in Sochi. " Previous Olympic success: Bronze: Nicky Gooch (1994) 500m Funding to Sochi: £2,953,400 Performance Target: 0-1 medal (or 2x top 8) Medals in Sochi: 0 Short-track speed skating can be cruel at the best of times, but Elise Christie suffered the worst of times. The 23-year-old was tipped to pick up medals in one or all of her disciplines - 500m, 1500m and 1,000m - but in each she was penalised for racing infringements. In the 500m final, she crossed the line second but was deemed to have caused an earlier collision. In her 1500m heat she came first but was ruled not to have crossed the proper finish line. Media playback is not supported on this device And in the semi-final of the 1000m - her favourite event - Christie was judged to have impeded a Chinese athlete as they both fell over. Christie also had to endure online abuse, mainly from South Korean fans after an incident with one of their athletes in the 500m. The only other Briton to reach a final was Jack Whelbourne, 22, but he crashed and hurt his ankle to finish last of the seven in the 1500m. Others: Whelbourne - 27th in 500m, 21st in 1000m; Jon Eley (29) - 7th in 500m, 25th in 1000m; Richard Shoebridge (28) - 27th in 1000m; Charlotte Gilmartin (23) - 16th in 500m; 28th in 1500m. Former Olympian and BBC short track commentator Wilf O'Reilly said: "The British team can fly home with their heads held high despite missing out on medals. They can feel proud that they've shown what short track is all about and how you cope with this rollercoaster sport. "The International Skating Union and the technical committee need to start looking at how they can make the sport, from a rules point of view, more understandable. Everybody keeps asking why Elise Christie was disqualified and so few people know. "If there is a penalty, the referee should announce it so the whole arena knows what it is, the commentators know and people at home know. Then it becomes far more interesting - you understand it. "What's important now is we not only have funding for the future to support the high-performance programme, but create funding to improve the grassroots development of the sport. " Previous Olympic success: Gold: Amy Williams (2010), silver: Shelley Rudman (2006), bronze: David Carnegie (1928), John Crammond (1948), Alex Coomber (2002) Funding to Sochi: £3,447,600 Performance Target: 1 medal Medals in Sochi: 1 (one gold) On the day of my competition, I got my TV licence bill through on email. There is of course reality but there is beauty in reality because I can't wait to get back into the UK Lizzy Yarnold followed up Amy Williams's success in Vancouver with victory in Sochi to keep the women's skeleton gold medal firmly in British hands. The 25-year-old went into the Sochi Games as the clear favourite and her commanding performance maintained Britain's great tradition of winning a medal in every Games the skeleton has been contested - six in all. Team-mate Shelley Rudman, 32, finished 16th in her third Olympics, while partner Kristan Bromley, 41, was eighth in his fourth Games and Dominic Parsons 10th on his Olympic debut. BBC pundit and 2010 Olympic champion Amy Williams said: "Lizzy is living proof that the British skeleton performance programme works. By getting the right people involved, making the right decisions, working hard, with the best equipment and the right coaching, you can produce an Olympic champion. It's exciting that when we get back there will be another huge talent search to find the next batch. "I don't have an answer as to why the men have not performed quite as well, historically, as the girls but there are some good young guys coming through and we've got to keep up the development, do the same things we did with Lizzy, and target four years' time. " Previous Olympic success: No medals (Alain Baxter's "bronze" in the 2002 slalom was rescinded for failing a drugs test) Funding to Sochi: £0 for alpine, £1,509,950 for freestyle skiing and snowboarding. Performance target: 1-2 medals Medals in Sochi: 1 (one bronze) Freestyle skiing and snowboarding The Sochi Games featured the new discipline of slopestyle, which was tipped as a possible source of British medals - and so it proved. Snowboarder Jenny Jones, 33, bagged Britain's first ever medal on snow with a bronze to kick start the GB medal haul. In the men's event, 20-year-old Jamie Nicholls was sixth with team-mate Billy Morgan, 24, 10th. Media playback is not supported on this device In the skiing equivalent, Britain's big hope James Woods, the 2012-13 World Cup winner, injured his hip in training and came fifth, while 18-year-old Katie Summerhayes was seventh. Zoe Gillings narrowly missed out on the snowboard cross final to place ninth. Halfpipe skier Rowan Cheshire, 18, a World Cup winner this season, missed the competition after a training accident put her in hospital with concussion. Others: Dom Harington (29) - 38th snowboard halfpipe; Ben Kilner (25) - 34th snowboard halfpipe; Emma Lonsdale (29) - 18th ski halfpipe; Murray Buchan (22) - 17th ski halfpipe; James Machon (23) - 23rd ski halfpipe. BBC commentator Ed Leigh said: "In 2006, we had Zoe Gillings and Lesley McKenna representing GB. In two Olympic cycles we've gone to a medal and six top-10 finishes. It's unbelievable really. They have had a bit of funding but it's down the passion and the grassroots of the sport in the UK. Hopefully I'll be in a few pub quizzes now "On a personal level for Jenny it has been a really important achievement, but for British freestyle skiing and snowboarding it could be the starting block of some huge investment both from UK Sport and other sponsorship and the sport could explode in the UK. "I'm very excited about the future. Woodsy is pretty disappointed, and is beating himself up, but the way he skied and what he managed to achieve with his hip injury was unbelievable. " Alpine skiing With no lottery funding for alpine skiing in the wake of Vancouver, only two skiers were able to satisfy performance criteria and make it to Sochi. 1924: Men (curling) 1936: Men (ice hockey) 1952: Jeannette Altwegg (figure skating) 1964: Tony Nash & Robin Dixon (two-man bobsleigh) 1976: John Curry (figure skating) 1980: Robin Cousins (figure skating) 1984: Jayne Torvill & Christopher Dean (figure skating) 2002: Women (curling) 2010: Amy Williams (skeleton) 2014: Lizzy Yarnold (skeleton) * Madge Syers won figure skating gold at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London Chemmy Alcott fought back from career-threatening double leg fracture in 2010 and a further break in 2013 to compete in her fourth Games. The 31-year-old finished 19th in downhill and 23rd in super-G. Dave Ryding, 27, fell foul of a devilish gate that caught out some of the world's best but recovered to finish 17th in the men's slalom. Five-time Olympic skier and BBC commentator Graham Bell said: "We had two top-20 performances, but there should have been more skiers here. I don't think the selection policy reflected the ability we have in alpine skiing and we should have seen the likes of Dougie Crawford and TJ Baldwin representing us in men's downhill. "They would certainly have been in the top half of the field which I thought was the BOA's rule of thumb for performance. "In my opinion, alpine selection criteria needs to be looked at, and also the funding needs to be looked at because alpine is the feeder into a lot of the other sports and participation-wise it dwarfs freestyle skiing and snowboarding amongst junior athletes. "So a good performance from Chemmy and Dave - but there should have been more of them. ".
The small aircraft came down in a field at Steve Powell's farm at Cwmbach, Builth Wells, Powys, just before 12:00 BST on Sunday. The men from Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, have been named locally as Scott Penlington and Nick Jefferies. Mr Powell said the aircraft appeared to have "fallen out of the sky into our field". "It is a terrible tragedy and we've never had anything like this before," he added. "The police are examining the wreckage but we don't know exactly what happened. " Dyfed Powys Police said recovery work has now been completed and the emergency services left the scene on Tuesday. A representative from the Independent Air Accidents Investigation Branch, in charge of the inquiry, mentioned that the debris was being transported back to their Farnborough headquarters for further analysis. He also noted that safety suggestions could be released in order to avoid comparable incidents in the future, should any problems be uncovered. Mr. Jefferies is a close friend of Harry Styles from One Direction as he was previously dating his 22-year-old daughter Emilie. Despite their romantic relationship ending, they remained on good terms, and Mr. Jefferies even gave Harry a ride in his small Cosmik plane.
The cabinet had tried to hold Thursday's meeting behind closed doors but was forced by a court order to hold it in public. A spokesman said Number 10 expected the council to "respect" the court ruling. Separately, the chief executive of the organisation which manages Grenfell Tower has agreed to "step aside". Leaders of Kensington and Chelsea Council swiftly concluded their meeting after 20 minutes, stating that holding an open meeting would "prejudice" the upcoming public inquiry. Sir Martin Moore-Bick, an appeal judge, was chosen on Thursday to head the public inquiry investigating the deaths of a minimum of 80 individuals. Angry demonstrations ensued after the failed meeting, which Labour councillor Robert Atkinson, representing Grenfell Tower, described as a "disaster". He yelled: "A complete disaster, this is why I am demanding your resignation." " Mr Atkinson, the Labour group leader on Kensington and Chelsea Council, told the BBC he was "ashamed" of the authority. He accused the leaders of "hiding from residents, they have been hiding from backbench councillors for over a week". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has demanded the resignation of the entire council leadership. The Labour mayor said the council's decision to scrap the meeting "beggars belief". And Andrew Gwynne MP, Labour's shadow communities and local government secretary, called for "commissioners to take control" of Kensington and Chelsea "if necessary". While he welcomed the Communities Secretary Sajid Javid's call for the democratic process to be open and transparent in the wake of Thursday night's abandoned meeting, he also called on him to "immediately ensure that all residents who are now homeless or in temporary accommodation are getting the support they need". Before the meeting, Mr Paget-Brown apologised for the authority's response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy, in which at least 80 people died. The Conservative councillor told BBC London he would not resign in the foreseeable future. On 22 June, the chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea Council Nicholas Holgate announced he was resigning following pressure from Mr Javid. A statement from Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO) confirmed its chief executive Robert Black had also resigned so he can "concentrate on assisting with the investigation and inquiry". In a statement released after the cabinet meeting was adjourned, Mr Paget-Brown said: "We are under sustained media criticism for a slow reaction to the fire, non-visibility and for failing to invest in north Kensington. "I believe that many of these criticisms need to be challenged and over time they will be, but I can think of nothing more demeaning to the memory of those lost and missing in the fire than seeking the resolution of political scores. ".
The 38th (Welsh) Division attacked the wood between 7 and 14 July 1916, with over 4,000 men killed or injured. A Great War Memorial Garden has been opened at Caernarfon Castle in Gwynedd, while a two-minute silence was observed at special ceremony in Cardiff. Commemorations took place as the sacrifices were marked in France. Cardiff's inaugural permanent tribute to residents who lost their lives in World War One was revealed at Hendre Park Lake at 10:58 BST alongside a two minute moment of silence. Over 1,000 trees have been put in place, forming a memorial forest. A service was also being held at the cenotaph in Blaenavon, Torfaen, to honour 18 local people killed during the battle and those who survived. In Caernarfon, hundreds of people filed into the castle grounds despite the rain, following a remembrance service at St Mary's Garrison Church in the town. A memorial garden has been established outside the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum in the castle, with members of the public invited to plant a cross and poppy to recall those killed and injured throughout World War One. Local politicians, military personnel and school children from across Gwynedd and Anglesey laid wreaths led by the Lord-Lieutenant for Gwynedd, Edmund Bailey. "It's massively important. A hundred years ago there were 4,000 Welshmen killed or injured in the Battle of Mametz Wood," he told BBC Wales. "I was intent that there should be somewhere local for people to be able to pay their respects, so they didn't have to go out to France, and they didn't have to go down to Cardiff or to London to do so. "It is quite fitting that it is here, because of course, Caernarfon Castle is the spiritual home of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. " Among those planting their own crosses in the new garden were year six pupils from Ysgol Rhosgadfan near Caernarfon. Headteacher Paul Carr emphasized the significance of ensuring that the students comprehend the historical context. The school decided to erect crosses representing the village of Rhosgadfan, where the school is located, as a tribute to those who have made sacrifices in the previous years.
The 23-year-old forward signed a two-year deal with the Saudi outfit from US Major League Soccer (MLS) club DC United for an undisclosed fee on Friday. "I'm delighted to join Al-Taawoun FC as I believe I have taken a good decision for my career," Kamara told BBC Sport. I'm fit to play as I successfully went through a medical check-up "I decided to move because I want to be playing regularly," Kamara said. Kamara was sent on loan to United States second tier league side Richmond Kickers as he struggled for playing time at DC United. He only managed to score one goal for DC United in nine games. Kamara, whose soccer career was put on hold in 2015 due to a serious illness, states that he passed a medical examination in Portugal before finalizing his contract with Al-Taawoun. Kamara confirmed that he is ready to play after passing a medical examination. Uefa's medical experts recommended that Kamara should refrain from playing football after discovering the issue. The condition was detected after he had scored six goals to help Norrkoping win the 2015 Swedish league. However Kamara decided to go the United States for further medical tests and specialists there gave him the green light to sign for DC United. He was surprisingly picked for Sierra Leone's opening 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying fixture against Kenya which they won 2-1 two weeks ago in Freetown. But Kamara did not feature in the match as he did not travel to Freetown because of a demand by his then club DC United that a defibrillator be at the stadium during the game. He now joins a list of Sierra Leonean internationals that have signed for Saudi Arabian clubs. They include former Leone Stars captain John Sama, David Simbo and ex-Inter Milan and Monaco forward Mohamed Kallon who won the Asia Champions League with Al-Itihad in 2005.
And those EU students who are already attending UK universities will continue to receive financial support. The Student Loans Company has attempted to provide students and applicants with confidence in light of the EU referendum. And Mr Johnson has posted on Twitter: "The UK is pleased to welcome EU students. " " "Current students and applicants for the upcoming autumn will still be eligible for student finance throughout their studies," the minister's Twitter post confirmed. Universities have been requesting clear information on how Brexit will impact their EU students, international programs, and funding from EU research initiatives. A statement from the Student Loans Company says that those EU students who are already studying in the UK will not face any changes to financial support, such as loans to cover tuition fees. The current arrangements will also remain in place for those who have applied and are expecting to begin university courses in the autumn. But the arrangements for EU students beginning courses in the following year - autumn 2017 - have still to be clarified. There are about 125,000 EU students in higher education in the UK, with Germany and France the biggest senders. But among those non-UK students starting university in the UK last year, there were more students from China than from all the EU countries put together. Following the vote to leave the EU, Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of universities, said that the Brexit  decision "creates significant uncertainty" for higher education. She said that the Russell Group universities would seek assurances from the government that "staff and students currently working and studying at our universities can continue to do so after the UK negotiates leaving the EU". Universities have been particularly concerned about the future of EU research funding, with analysis by the Royal Society showing that the UK is one of the largest recipients. It suggests that between 2007 and 2013, the UK received 8. 8bn euros (Â£7. 3bn) in direct EU research funding and had contributed 5. 4bn euros (Â£4. 5bn). But there are examples, such as Norway and Switzerland, that are outside the EU but are able to contribute funds and have "associate country" status for EU research projects. These associate member countries do not have a say in how such research funding is directed.
It is a direct quote from the man himself and reads: "I leave an institution that has the potential to reach broad audiences across the UK and abroad, through its own programmes, partnerships and online. " It's that word "potential" that sticks out. What does he mean "potential"? He's talking about an institution that has developed - on his watch - from a well respected but modestly visited gallery in Pimlico to an international art megabrand boasting the most visited museum of modern art in the world (Tate Modern), two hugely popular regional galleries, a country-wide network of partnerships and a lending programme that sees Tate's collection of British art presented in major museums from Beijing to Boston. By most people's reckoning, Nicholas Serota has already delivered on Tate's "potential". But obviously, he perceives it differently, demonstrating his character and providing an explanation for his successful tenure at Tate. He is not one to be content with complacency. His comment about "potential" reflects three aspects to his character: a predisposition not to blow his own trumpet, a relentless drive, and a challenging nature. He doesn't want the next incumbent to think he or she has an easy ride: there is work to be done. He may be departing, but he is establishing the priorities before his departure. The leading candidate, in my opinion, is Maria Balshaw, who has performed admirably in her role at the Whitworth in Manchester and in managing the city's cultural initiatives. Another strong candidate is Iwona Blazwick, the longtime director of the Whitechapel Gallery in east London, who played a key role in shaping Tate Modern's curatorial approach during her time at the gallery in the late '90s. Frances Morris has been long considered as the next in line after Serota, following a similar career trajectory from Whitechapel to Tate. She is currently the leading internal contender for the position, despite having just assumed the role of director at Tate Modern. Jessica Morgan, who recently left, could also be considered, but she has only just begun her role as the head of the DIA Art Foundation. The search team is bound to look further afield. Klaus Biesenbach from MoMA PS1 might get a call, as could super-curator Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, and quite possibly Michael Govan of the LA County Museum. Finally, Tim Marlow from the Royal Academy and Matthew Slotover, the co-founder of Frieze, are both notable figures who could bring something new to the party.
Wakefield Council will use the Heritage Lottery Fund grant to open parts of Pontefract Castle not accessible since the mid-1600s. Work will include restoring paths and platforms which will allow visitors to reach the Sally Port and Swillington Tower areas of the site. It could see the castle removed from English Heritage's 'at risk' register. Further work will include extending the arts and crafts area to include a shop and café. Wakefield Council and English Heritage are poised to provide additional funding for the £3.5m project. Councillor Peter Box, leader of the council, said: "We are delighted that Heritage Lottery Fund is supporting our work. "The money will help put Pontefract on the map for tourists, building on what is an already popular site, and will certainly bring wider economic benefits into the town. The castle, constructed in the 11th Century, is said to be where King Richard II was imprisoned and killed. It served as a Lancastrian fortress during the Wars of the Roses (1454-85). During the English Civil War (1642-1651) the Royalist castle was besieged by Parliamentarian forces and was demolished in 1649 on the request of the townspeople. Since then, the castle has been used as a place for liquorice cultivation and as a tourist attraction.
Students and staff at the INTO language skills centre in the Haymarket area had to leave the building on Tuesday night. A controlled detonation was carried out by a bomb disposal unit on the Town Moor during the early morning hours. An 18-year-old male was apprehended in London. The university said the campus was now open as normal. No-one was reported injured and police said there was no danger to the public. A spokesman for Newcastle University said: "The INTO building is now open for staff and students following last night's evacuation and we are working closely with Northumbria Police with their on-going inquiries. " Roads in the area reopened before 01:00 BST. A spokesman for Northumbria Police said: "Residents around Newcastle Town Moor may have heard a slight bang and I would like to reassure them this is in connection with the incident at the University and was planned. Investigations are in the initial phases and we are collaborating closely with Newcastle University. There is no reason for students and the broader community to be worried at this time. " Newcastle University caters for more than 22,000 UK and international students and has 1,200 academic staff. The INTO Centre offers facilities for more than 700 mainly international students and is spread over four floors.
According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men. Given such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed "the Cinderella cancer". "We just don't make enough of it" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. "On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked". Based at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered. "What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity. And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour. " But if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage? That - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. Researchers from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London conducted a large-scale study examining samples from over 200,000 individuals, half of whom had cancer and half who did not. The findings revealed 23 previously unidentified gene variants linked to prostate cancer, as well as 16 associated with more aggressive types of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer. "It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer," says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. "That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years". If that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery. Sitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive. As with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum. "The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery" says Prof Neal. "It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient".
The Dons are seven points behind Rangers in second, with a game in hand, after a 2-1 defeat at Ross County. McInnes has led Aberdeen to runners-up finishes behind Celtic - who they trail by 18 points - for the last two years. "When I was in charge at Pittodrie, there was constant pressure to secure a second-place finish," Miller explained. "Derek is facing that same pressure now. " "But Derek has put himself in a position and only has himself to blame because he has done very well since going there and has already finished second. Expectations are set to rise now, and complaints from fans will likely follow. It is important to acknowledge this feedback and start working on improvements. "You have got to win games, it is about results now and the pressure will be on him a bit. It is how he handles that. " Saturday's defeat in Dingwall was Aberdeen's fourth defeat in their last eight league games, while Rangers have won eight and drawn two of their last 11 Premiership matches to move clear in second. Miller, who played more than 550 games for the club in a trophy-laden 18-year career before a three-year spell as manager from 1992 to 1995, believes the Dons have suffered from inconsistent selection this season. But he believes they still have a squad capable of overhauling Rangers and delivering a third straight runners-up spot. "I thought [at the outset] that Aberdeen would have finished second this season, if you look at the strength in depth they have," he told BBC Scotland's Sunday Sportsound. "That brings its own issues and can put it in the manager's mind that he might want to change his personnel, and Aberdeen haven't had a consistent selection this season. "Although they are still playing well, losing at Ibrox - where they played well but were beaten - has had an adverse effect. That puts pressure on the players and the manager and how do they handle that pressure? "They had an opportunity in midweek [against Motherwell] to close the gap but the floodlights went out. "Visiting Ross County is always a challenge, especially when they suffer a loss despite playing well and when County is reduced to 10 men. This defeat is a major hit to the team's confidence, and it will require a united effort from everyone at Pittodrie to bounce back. " I still believe that the team they possess is able to secure the second position.
For years Philip Hammond has been dubbed the ultimate boring accountant whose idea of fun is to spend his holidays poring over spreadsheets. Well, he is certainly not an accountant. And there is mixed evidence on the boring front. Hammond does - according to his former ministerial colleague Sir Peter Luff - infuriate his wife Susan by taking spreadsheets to the beach. But friends dating back to Hammond's days at Shenfield High School in the 1970s recall a long-haired teenager who, with a twinkle in the eye, drove fellow sixth-formers to the pub for lunch. Nina Stratford, one of his pub lunch partners, told us something about Hammond that has probably never been said publicly before about a chancellor of the exchequer. "I remember going round to his house once. We got hold of half a bottle of sherry and proceeded to drink it, and very randomly we ended up having a bit of a cheeky snog," she says. "Who'd have thought that Philip Hammond was such a good kisser?" It was the era of 1970s Glam Rock and Hammond launched a highly successful career as an entrepreneur by running discos. After Oxford he made a mint in residential and commercial building in the 1980s and 1990s. The Hammond fortune, which gave him the keys to a smart Jaguar car, allowed him to fulfil the Michael Heseltine criterion to ensure success in politics. He entered Parliament at the relatively late age of 41 in 1997 as a millionaire, ensuring he would not be beholden to anyone. And now, two decades later, Philip Hammond has achieved his dream job in circumstances he could never have imagined. He has taken charge of the UK economy at what he regards as a potentially perilous moment after the Brexit referendum. In a series of interviews with friends from his school days in Essex and from his earliest in politics a quarter of a century ago I have been introduced to the two sides of Philip Hammond. First there is an unsurprising figure: "Spreadsheet Phil" who devoured the Daily Telegraph at school and whose hour may now have come at this tricky moment for the public finances. And then there is Phil, the resourceful entrepreneur and confident charmer who served Bacardi to his mates in his Shenfield bedroom which was out of bounds to his parents. The chancellor will need to draw on both these sides of his personality as he embarks on two historic challenges which may dwarf even those faced by his two immediate predecessors who lived through the global financial crash and its aftermath. In the first place, Hammond believes he needs to prepare the economy for what he fears could be a bumpy ride once the Brexit negotiations are formally launched in the spring. And then there is the other challenge he is pursuing on his own terms - ensuring that Britain achieves a soft landing as it leaves the EU. Former school friends painted a picture of a highly intelligent teenager who had the confidence to challenge, in a friendly way, his left-wing history teacher. Fellow-pupil Richard Madeley, the television presenter, recalls: "He would always finish his work in class ahead of everybody else. He was very very bright. "And then he put his big boots on the desk and start reading the Telegraph and swapping political dialogue with our history teacher who was a Guardian reader. "And usually towards the end of the class they would swap papers and then they would sort of score jolly points off each other making political points. " Wind forward three decades and Philip Hammond now finds himself one of the central figures as a new political order takes shape after the Brexit vote. Passing acquaintances when at Oxford, Hammond and Theresa May enjoy a constructive, though not especially close, working relationship. But there is irritation in the Treasury at briefings that he is resistant to her mission to champion the so-called JAMs, people who are Just About Managing. He sees the need to target help on people struggling, but says that his main priority is to stabilise the economy after the Brexit vote. This will mean abandoning George Osborne's plan to achieve an overall budget surplus by 2020. The chancellor's old political friend, former transport minister Stephen Hammond, says his namesake wants to make clear he is not going soft on the deficit. He said: "Intellectually the framework remains the same - that we intend to achieve a fiscal surplus within the life of the next parliament. " Stephen Hammond also gave me an insight into Hammond's thinking on the EU. The chancellor is so concerned about business uncertainty he believes the UK should negotiate a transitional deal with the EU to cover future trading relations at the same time as the Brexit talks. Theresa May appeared to float this idea on Tuesday, only for her aides to back away. Stephen Hammond told me: "Leaving in two years' time without a deal would be catastrophic for this country. "And I think it is clear that one of the things Philip is increasingly coming to realise is that we may need to put in place transitional arrangements so that negotiations don't have to stop in two years' time - it may well be in our national interest to continue those negotiations for some time to get the best deal for Britain. " In private, friends told me, Mr Hammond is unimpressed by what he regards as the excessively optimistic claims of the Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Liam Fox. But he is re-establishing an alliance with the third Brexiteer, his one time boss David Davis. Friends say Mr Hammond regards the Brexit secretary as a grown-up who is immersing himself in the gritty detail of his job. Britain is being formally introduced to both Philip Hammonds for the first time. Spreadsheet Philip could be the right person for the current situation as the state of public finances becomes uncertain. But Phil, the confident charmer, will need all his political wiles to survive the choppy Brexit waters ahead. Nicholas Watt is political editor for BBC Newsnight. You can watch his report here.
GB's 2008 men's 4x400m relay team moved up from fourth to third after Russia's Denis Alekseyev failed a drugs test when his sample was retested. The idea had been proposed that the medal ceremony could be held at the World Championships in London in August. However, the Anniversary Games next month also occur at London's Olympic Stadium. A decision is yet to be made on when Rooney and team-mates Andrew Steele, Robert Tobin and Michael Bingham will receive their medals. Rooney, 30, told BBC Radio 5 live: "I don't want to be distracted. I need to go to the World Championships and focus on that, so if we could get it done at the Diamond League, I'd love that. "There's no way of getting back to Beijing and doing it that way, but if we can go to an Olympic stadium and be in front of a British crowd, that would be amazing. "But whatever happens, whenever it happens, I just can't wait to get on that podium. " The International Olympic Committee has reallocated medals from Beijing after Alekseyev and compatriots Anastasiya Kapachinskaya and Inga Abitova tested positive for banned substance Turinabol. The women's 4x400m relay team from Britain has advanced to the bronze medal spot. Christine Ohuruogu, Kelly Sotherton, Marilyn Okoro, and Nicola Sanders initially crossed the finish line in fifth place, but have now moved up to third after Russia and Belarus, who finished third and fourth, were disqualified for failing subsequent tests. The men's Beijing medals are in the possession of the British Olympic Association and British Athletics but an announcement is still to be made on where they will be awarded. They could be presented at next month's Diamond League Anniversary Games, or at the World Championships in London in August. But, as the World Championships is an IAAF event, the IOC would have to give permission for any presentation to take place as Olympic medals fall under their jurisdiction. British Athletics does not have possession of medals for the women's 4x400m team yet as legal proceedings are ongoing regarding athletes in their race. Britons Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill, Jo Pavey, Sotherton and Goldie Sayers are among those waiting to receive Olympic and World Championship medals they were denied by drugs cheats. Sayers has told the Guardian she would be "gutted" if she did not receive her medal at the World Championships this summer.
The world's first purpose-built motor-racing circuit opened at Brooklands, in Surrey, 110 years ago on 17 June. The Earl of March ceremonially unveiled the finishing straight, and this was succeeded by a procession of classic cars. The finishing straight had been concealed by an airplane hangar since 1940, but it was later taken down, renovated, and moved to a different location on the premises. The initiative was completed with assistance from a Heritage Lottery Fund grant totaling £4. 7m, a government grant of £1m, and contributions raised by backers and benefactors. The Grade II-listed Wellington Hangar was used for the assembly of Wellington bombers in the 1940s, and later for other industrial purposes. It is due to be opened in October as the Brooklands Aircraft Factory, housing rare and early aviation displays and telling the story of 80 years of aircraft testing, manufacture and flying at Brooklands.
Co-ordinated by Kew's Millennium Seed Bank, it aims to safeguard the genetic diversity of the UK's tree flora. The scheme will initially target 50 native species, including the common ash, which is under threat across Europe from ash dieback. The project's funding has been provided by the People's Postcode Lottery. "In the last 10 years, we have seen an increasing threat to our trees from many newly arrived, often very aggressive, pests and diseases," explained Paul Smith, head of Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. "In 2013, almost all of our favourite tree species - from oak to beech and ash - are affected. " Safeguarding species Researchers involved in the collection will focus their efforts on 50 species, which have been selected and ranked according to a range of criteria, including conservation status, prevalence in the landscape and vulnerability to pests and diseases. "We currently don't have such a facility, and the UK is unusual in that, where you have access to a wide range of diversity in one place," Dr Smith told BBC News. "We send out seeds all of the time all over the place, as well as in the UK, so it is ironic that we do not have comprehensive collections for the most important trees in our landscape. " In partnership with the Forestry Commission, the scheme will collect seeds of the prioritised species from 24 seed zones, identified by the commission, across the UK. A species will only be considered to be fully represented in the national tree seed collection when it has been collected across its distribution or from all genetically distinct populations. Dr Smith observed: "We have looked at our native species first because they are out there in the landscape and many of them are vulnerable. "New pests and diseases have come into the UK, so there is an urgency related to that. "In terms of genetic diversity, although we have the vast majority of tree species in the seed bank, we only have one or two collections from each [species] so you are not sampling right across populations. "One thing that ash dieback has made clear is that only a subset of the UK population may have resistance, so you really need to be collecting right across the genetic spectrum in order to be able to provide a wide range of material for screening purposes. " Since being recorded in the UK's wider environment for the first time in 2012, ash dieback had propelled the issue of tree health into the headlines. Researchers at the John Innes Centre (JIC) and The Sainsbury Laboratory (TSL) recently released the first cryo-electron microscope images of the fungus responsible for causing ash dieback. "The benefit of this method is that the sample is imaged in as close to its natural state as possible, providing the best quality 3D view of an organism and its topography," explained JIC researcher Prof Allan Downie. "We want to understand how the fungus makes the fruiting bodies (toadstools) that produce the spores. "We think the spores cause infection of ash. We think the fungus growing within the ash leaf stem produces sex organs and that the images show such an organ. " Dr Robin Probert, head of conservation and technology at Kew's seed bank, explained why ash was listed as one of the collection's priority species. "We must gather various populations of ash across the UK in order to discover populations that are resistant to disease," he informed BBC News. "By storing this material here, researchers will have access to it for testing disease resistance and potentially using it as a foundation for replanting strains in the wild." "It is the same story for all the other tree species that we are looking to collect and preserve. Until now, there has not been a push to build up a full genetic representation of important tree species, and ash happens to be one of them. ".
The facility was built to hold nearly 700 prisoners, but the league's report found the Category B site had more than 1,200 inmates at the end of January. The charity found that 64 of the 75 Category B and Category C men's prisons in England and Wales had more inmates than they were designed to hold. Leicester had 361 prisoners instead of 214 and Wandsworth was 663 over. The league analysed Ministry of Justice (MoJ) data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The prison population rose from 83,062 to 83,680, across the period looked at. Overcrowding was particularly extreme in Exeter, Preston, Durham, and Doncaster prisons, as reported by the league. The information indicates that inmates are increasingly being placed in cells designed for one person with two or three prisoners sharing a single cell. The league said that on a typical day, almost 19,000 prisoners were doubled-up and about 800 were trebled-up. Source: The Howard League for Penal Reform Chief Executive Frances Crook said: "Far too many people are being sent into already overcrowded jails and the need to stem the flow is now urgent. "Government must get a grip on a prison system in crisis that is feeding the crime problem and creating more victims. " Prisons minister Andrew Selous said: "We always have enough space within our prisons to accommodate all offenders and will never be in a position where we can't imprison those sentenced by the courts. All correctional facilities maintain manageable levels of inmates, and data that has been released demonstrates that overcrowding is currently at its lowest point since 2007/08.
The Family Division of the High Court said the boy should receive care to minimise suffering in his final months. He was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2012. His parents had argued that doctors could still treat his symptoms. He is anticipated to survive for three to six months, and experts stated that "curative treatment" was no longer an option. Physicians informed the court that the boy should receive "palliative chemotherapy" to alleviate pain, along with medication. But his mother, a former nurse, said she thought the tumour was slow growing, and was worried about the side effects of chemotherapy and a "cocktail of painkillers". The boy's parents had appealed for their "beautiful" son's "right to life", and his father wept as the judge outlined the decision. Mr Justice MacDonald said the case was "unbearably sad" and said the youngster's parents were suffering "unimaginable agony". But the judge said he was satisfied the boy's prognosis was terminal and that pain could become unbearable if not treated. The treatment put forward by doctors was in the boy's best interests, he added. The hearing was not open to the public and the judge banned the reporting of anything which might identify the boy, including his age, address or name of hospital authority with responsibility for care. Mr Justice MacDonald said: "Neither the mother or the father in this case are anything other than loving parents who are simply trying to stay upright in the darkening storm which has engulfed their family. ".
Are hopes for a DUP-Tory deal fading fast? The News Letter isn't too optimistic, reporting that a DUP source has said the two are  "miles apart". It reports that sticking points are thought to include DUP demands for "additional funding" for Northern Ireland. The paper says the price the party is putting on its involvement is £2bn. There's a striking image on the front page of the Irish News - a huge bonfire with a flag atop it. Last week, Belfast City Council removed pallets from a "notorious pyre" near the Holiday Inn hotel in Belfast city centre. The paper moves the story along with some  "fresh revelations". It claims Belfast City Council is now storing the pallets in a council yard but will return them to the site on the Eleventh night. The Belfast Telegraph leads with "Priest at crisis hit school quizzed boys about sex". It reports that De La Salle College  in west Belfast has been criticised for its response to complaints from pupils about a priest who asked them "sexual questions" during confession. It was part of an independent report in 2013 into specific child protection concerns at the school. Several pupils aged 13-15 complained about the unnamed priest asking them about sexual habits. The schools response was described in the report as "inappropriate". The paper's front page also shows the face of an 18-year-old whose driving was described as one of "the worst" a judge had ever seen. Jessica Stirling, a "restricted" driver, gained widespread attention after a video surfaced of her overtaking a car and then abruptly veering onto the hard shoulder on the opposite side of the road. Despite this, she was able to avoid imprisonment thanks to a four-month suspended sentence lasting two years. There is potentially bad news for those looking forward to the Champions League qualifier at Windsor Park on the 11 July. The Belfast Telegraph shows a picture of an empty stadium and says there's a good chance that is how it could look on match night. It reports the PSNI is set to veto the controversial match between Celtic and Linfield, which would be played if the Blues reach the second qualifying round of the Champions League. There had been fears about security risks of the match being played when it coincides with the Twelfth celebrations in Northern Ireland. The paper reports that sources say the PSNI has concluded that staging the match in Belfast on the Eleventh night simply poses "too much of a risk". Newly-elected DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly hasn't been in the job a month, but she's already had requests from her some of her constituents. The Irish News reports that the former DUP special advisor has been urged to call for the removal of flags put up in a "mixed area" of south Belfast. The paper reports that "dozens of loyalist flags" were put up earlier this week. Sinn Féin MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir has urged her to request the removal of the flags, stating that the neighborhood is diverse and the flags are unwelcome. On Wednesday, it was announced that actor Daniel Day Lewis had surrendered his Equity card and retired from acting. The Irish News reveals that "The Boxer" actor was trained for his role in the movie by Belfast boxing coach Damien Deeney from Holy Trinity boxing club in Turf Lodge in 1997. Michael Hawkins from the club recalled that the actor had done a "good session" at the club and it was clear he wanted to learn. " He may be retiring, but like any good boxer it might be hard to keep him down.
The hospital said there was flooding in the resuscitation and assessment area and ambulances were being diverted. A spokesperson mentioned that the capacity to assist patients was greatly impacted and people were urged to consider alternative solutions such as seeking advice from their doctor or reaching out to NHS Direct. The flooding was connected to a hot water pipe leak. No one has been injured, he added.
The Horncastle Theatre Company faced the possibility of being kicked out of the Lion Theatre the previous year when the pub was shuttered and abandoned in 2013. The theater had been operating behind the Red Lion Hotel in Horncastle, Lincolnshire for thirty years. It was mentioned that the entire community was pleased to see the pub reopen and the theater group remain. Company chairwoman Shirley Moffat said: "It is a real community asset and we have turned a new page now. " New landlord Andy Melling said he recognised how important it was to people in the town.
For years people have complained that great British ideas only make money when they are exploited by foreign firms, often American or Chinese. Now a group of British universities has been rated the best in the world at helping scientists turn their creativity into cash. The SETsquared Partnership - a collaboration between the universities of Bath, Bristol, Exeter, Southampton and Surrey - was ranked "Number One" by respected independent research group, University Business Incubators (UBI). They call it a business incubator. A place for baby businesses to grow. Where scientists and digital developers can meet lawyers, accountants, marketing experts. UBI analysed more than 1,200 incubators, based in 64 countries, measuring their performance in 60 different areas, including total investment, the number of jobs created and the number of successful firms born out of the incubator. 'SETsquared' came top, beating Ryerson University in Canada and the Chaoyang University of Technology, Taiwan. Dhruv Bhatli, one of UBI's founders, explained the centre's success. "SETsquared is the top performing business incubator globally as it consistently outperforms on our three assessment categories; value for ecosystem, value for client and attractiveness," he said. That is the dry business analysis. For Bristol PhD student Tom Carter, SETsquared has turned an idea into a £10m business in a year. Working in a university lab, Mr Carter created "feeling without touching". He demonstrated how to control a computer game simply by moving a hand in mid-air, the gestures controlling what happened on screen. Mr Carter calls his device "Ultrahaptics", a fusion of haptics - the science of touch - and ultrasound technology. An array of small ultrasound emitters are responsible for creating the feeling in the user's fingers, linked by software to a camera which sees how the hand is moving. The technology has captured global interest. Auto companies are working on systems that could change the volume of a car's stereo or adjust the heating temperature through gestures in the air. Kitchen appliance firms are creating a hob with no buttons, the heat turned up simply by a wave of your hand. But when he made his discoveries, Mr Carter was doing his PhD at Bristol University, and knew nothing about building a business. SETsquared introduced him to lawyers, to protect and patent his invention; to accountants and HR experts to create a company; and most importantly of all, to a man who has become his business partner. Steve Cliffe had worked for 30 years in the Bristol technology sector, before he met Tom Carter. He said it was the best idea he had ever seen. Now, Ultrahaptics chief executive, Mr Cliffe said: "The response from customers is amazing; we have a piece of technology they want. This is going to be huge. " Interest is so strong that Ultrahaptics has recently received £10m of investment from City backers. There are serious applications for touchless controls. Mr Cliffe added: "The dirtiest place in a hospital are the buttons on the lift. Lift manufacturers are very interested. "We can allow people to choose the floor they want to go to, simply by waving their hand. That way, we cut down germs and infection. " In all, SETsquared firms have attracted £26m of investment in the past year, creating 100 jobs. Since the centres were set up, it is estimated they have contributed £3. 8bn to the UK economy. But the impact is wider than that. Simon Bond, SETsquared's director of innovation, put it like this: "Bristol and Bath is a leading tech hub outside of London. "The region has produced an incredible wealth of technology companies and products, and SETsquared is very proud to have played our part in putting it on the map as one of the most innovative areas in the UK. " Tom Carter has still not finished that PhD. "I'm too busy now," he said. Last week he was in Korea and Japan. In January, he and the team are going to Las Vegas for the big American Consumer Electronics Show. Every session is sold out as the world queues up to feel his invisible technology. That PhD may have to wait a while.
He passed away a few days ago after contracting an unidentified virus. The feline mysteriously turned up at volunteer-run Rushden Station about 10 years ago just after the previous station cat had passed away, and quickly made it his home. A JustGiving page was established last week to help cover Alfie's veterinary expenses after he fell ill, raising a total of Â£850. The beloved orange tabby cat had a dedicated Facebook page with fans from around the globe. In a post written about Alfie's death, the author of the page wrote that Alfie's vet bills had been covered by the donations. The rest of the funds will go towards constructing a memorial at the station in a prominent spot. Many people have offered their sympathies for the cat. One wrote: "So very sorry to hear of Alfie's passing. He knew how much he was loved, by you, his humans and by everyone he met at the station and his fans!" Another added: "I have so enjoyed in the last couple of years seeing about all of his doings at the station and how treasured a member of the community he was. ".
Northumbria Healthcare NHS Trust is "one of the best hospital trusts in England", chief inspector of hospitals Prof Sir Mike Richards said. The Care Quality Commission stated that the trust was described as "compassionate, efficient, and well-managed". The trust's new Cramlington A&E hospital has been scrutinized for extended waiting times and the distance that some critically ill patients need to travel to reach it. The Â£75m centre was the first in England purpose built to treat only emergency cases, with consultants on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But the plan for its opening also included the downgrading of A&E at the trust's North Tyneside General, Wansbeck General and Hexham General hospitals, which now offer a walk-in service for less serious conditions. Sir Mike said, however, there was a "consistency of the outstanding ratings across all four hospital locations and across community services". "To achieve this across so many sites is truly remarkable and is a first," he said. Trust chief executive David Evans said it was a "wonderful achievement" so soon after the trust "brought about a huge clinical change with our new emergency care centre". A&E at Cramlington was rated good overall with some areas of improvement needed. The trust "already knew about and were already working on" areas highlighted by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), Mr Evans said. The trust said it had encountered A&E patient numbers "far in excess" of those anticipated, including walk-in patients which were not supposed to use the acute unit. CQC regional head of hospital inspections Amanda Stanford said the trust had "struggled" with emergency waiting times. But she said patient feedback overall had been "extremely positive" despite a number of criticisms on the NHS Choices website. The CQC had faith in the trust's capacity to address and gain insights from complaints, particularly those relating to A&E and waiting times, Ms Stanford mentioned. Inspections of the trust, both scheduled and unscheduled, were conducted towards the close of the previous year. The CQC found leadership was inspirational and recent changes in services had been managed effectively. Hospital and community services were strongly integrated and support for young people with complex needs was "excellent", inspectors found. Staff were compassionate, polite and respectful and went out of their way to meet patients' needs, the report said.
This funding request is only the start of a budgetary process, but even at the outset the Trump figures are not quite what they seem. The outgoing Obama administration was also projecting an increase in defence spending in 2018 - up by about $35bn, so actually the Trump "increase" in dollar terms is some $19bn. The Trump administration's numbers have already drawn criticism from leading law-makers on Capitol Hill. Senator John McCain, who chaired a bi-partisan panel on the re-building of the US military that reported in January, insists that the Trump Administration is not planning to spend enough. "With a world on fire,", said Mr McCain, "America cannot secure peace through strength with just 3% more than President Obama's budget. We can and must do better. " He has argued for spending some $640bn on defence next year, in contrast to Mr Trump's $603bn, rising to a total of $800bn by 2022. These are huge figures for a country whose defence budget already outstrips all of its main competitors. True, the US remains the only global military player. True, the world is changing - China and Russia are both proving more assertive in areas that they regard as being of key strategic concern. But the problems facing the US military also stem from fundamental technological changes, and a shift in what the US armed services might be expected to do. The counter-insurgency wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that have dominated US military thinking over the past decade are not over. But one phase is winding down, even if Mr Trump's plans may see a stepped-up US role in the short-term against so-called Islamic state. These wars have shaped a generation of US officers. They have required painful lessons about counter-insurgency operations to be re-learnt. But they have also meant that skills and equipment for high-end warfare have in some cases atrophied. A rising China and increasingly assertive Russia are exposing notable weaknesses in the US military's lineup. There are numerous instances. Stryker armoured vehicles equipped with 30mm cannons are being developed and tested and will be rushed to forward deployed US units in Europe, addressing the concern that current Russian equivalents carry a much greater punch than the existing US vehicles. US generals have been hugely impressed with Russian artillery and electronic warfare capabilities displayed during the fighting in eastern Ukraine. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the US and its allies had near total dominance of the electronic spectrum and their forces are not as well-versed as they used to be in operating in a contested electronic environment. The problems are evident for the US Navy and Air Force too. There have inevitably been periods when an aircraft carrier has not been available for deployment to the Middle East due to commitments in the Asia-Pacific region. And significant numbers of aircraft are temporarily out of service as they wait for either spare parts or a place in the long lines for maintenance. Over and above all this, there is a growing realisation that US technical dominance is eroding. The so-called military revolution of the 1980s and 1990s - smart-weapons, precision guidance, unmanned systems - were all based on decades of US scientific and technical leadership. But no longer. US experts are worried about the advancements China is making in artificial intelligence, leading to doubts about the US's ability to maintain a competitive edge in crucial military technologies moving forward. And this is where the original Trump budget proposal creates more uncertainties than solutions. What is the Trump administration's strategy that the new recast US military will serve? Numbers are important - but they are only part of the story of military power. It is things like capability and readiness that matter. How is all of this connected to a more comprehensive strategic plan? The increase in defense spending under Trump will have consequences. He is pushing for reductions in funding for the State Department, which includes foreign aid expenditures. But many commentators - including former military men - have argued that this spending too is an integral part of maintaining order in an increasingly chaotic world. Diplomacy and military capability must go hand-in-hand. Again, the Trump administration appears to lack any real vision of how the multiple aspects of US power can work in concert.
Blackwell retained his British middleweight title on Saturday with a unanimous points decision at the end of a gruelling bout with Jack Arnfield. And Hennessy was impressed with the performance of the Wiltshire fighter. "He is the dark horse of the middleweight division," Hennessy told BBC Wiltshire. "We are going after the Lonsdale belt, the European title and then a genuine world title. He can definitely win a world title and win it in style because he is the type of fighter everyone wants to see in this country - a great TV fighter. " Blackwell, with three losses and a single draw in his 23-fight professional career, will retain his British title belt if he successfully defends it for a third time, which he states is his next goal. "I'm gaining experience," he stated. "I want to defend it again and win it outright. One more defence and it is mine, I never thought in a million years that when I laced up a pair of gloves I would be winning a British title. " Hennessy says he would like that next defence to be against interim WBA middleweight title champion Eubank Jr, but does not hold much hope of it happening. "The board has recently authorized Chris Eubank junior so we'll see if he shows up," he stated. We are eager for that bout, however it should be emphasized that the board has already arranged two elimination matches with Nick and Chris Eubank junior, both of which he has pulled out of. "We'd love him to, it would be a British super-fight, it's what everyone is in the game for. We extended a generous proposal for him to compete on this local route but they opted for a different direction.
Jon Lewis' side have a core of local players, many produced by the academy at Chester-le-Street, with both veterans, stalwarts and newcomers all ready to play their part this term. So who is going to lead the county's bid to win a fourth County Championship title? Stokes' return to Durham for the start of the County Championship season might give fans a rare glimpse of his talents at the Riverside, after a winter away with England. His last appearance for the national team came in agonising World Twenty20 final defeat by West Indies, in which he was hit for four consecutive sixes by Carlos Brathwaite in the final over, with them needing 19 to win. County captain Paul Collingwood was with England as part of Trevor Bayliss' coaching team, and a familiar face at a tough time for all. "Ben Stokes is the heartbeat of the England side, has plenty of friends in that dressing room but I know Stokesy really well," Collingwood told BBC Newcastle. "When he goes through something as tough as that in such a big occasion he's obviously going to be upset. "But he's the kind of character that bounces back straight away and he'll be desperate to get himself and his team into a situation like that again. "Hopefully he'll have learned so much from those four balls he bowled in that over and make him stronger for the future. "I'm sure he got a lot of people who put their arms around him and gave him a lot of advice and he'll be bouncing back in the future no doubt about that. " Collingwood, even at 39 and his 20th year with Durham, was a key player in 2015, only missing one Championship game. Despite the ongoing speculation about his retirement is determined to play his part again in 2016. Media playback is not supported on this device "Every year for the last three I've gone into it saying it my last season, so this year I'm going to try to play as much as I can," he said. "The body still feels pretty good, I'm still enjoying it, I've still got plenty of ambition to go out there and do well, so I want to play as long as I can. " Few counties possess such devastating and experienced bowling attacks as Durham, with Graham Onions and Chris Rushworth leading the unit and cameos from England duo Mark Wood and Stokes. Media playback is not supported on this device Onions, 33, finished 2015 with 66 wickets while Rushworth, 29, was the Professional Cricketers Association player of the year with 90. "I don't feel pressure, whether or not people say there is pressure," Rushworth said. "We've got some big players here so I'm not feeling any pressure and will keep doing my job. " The combination of the two local lads has been a backbone of the county in recent seasons, although last year might take some catching for both. "That was a really good season, but it's very hard to put into words what Rushy did," Onions added. "He'll look back on that and think it was an incredible season and to break the records was an amazing achievement. Jack Burnham's name has been talked about in different circles following an impressive performance for England under-19s in the World Cup tournament earlier this year. Media playback is not supported on this device The 19-year-old hit three centuries, finishing with 420 runs and is hopeful of adding to his four Championship appearances in 2015. "It's been very good, I've learned a lot and played a lot better than I thought I was going to do," Burnham said. "It's been a pleasure to be out there for my country with the under-19s team, but it's good to be home back at Durham to crack on. "For the guys to speak about me in such a positive way, it really boosts my confidence in my abilities and motivates me to perform at my best. "They may tease us a bit, but it's all in good fun. I used to admire these players growing up, and now being in the same locker room with them is a true honor. " ".
Bartlomiej, 30, who was in rehab in his native Poland, lost 1. 5 litres of blood in a haemorrhage caused by his habit. Meanwhile, Freedom of Information requests revealed dozens of reports of thefts across seven hospitals. Since 2012 police have been called, staff attacked and patients, not linked to the gang, have lost consciousness. Bartlomiej, who did not wish to give his surname, lived in London for more than a year. He said: "We lived in various places, always nearby hospitals. "We were squatting, or we just illegally lived in houses or different accommodation. "Those were the places we were binge drinking. It's a really simple life. " He listed Charing Cross Hospital, King's College Hospital, North Middlesex Hospital, St George's Hospital, Lambeth Hospital and Hammersmith Hospital as among the institutions they targeted. Bartlomiej continued: "You don't have to steal it because it's widely available - we've just been walking in with a plastic cup. "If it was manual dispenser we just filled a half of a cup of this spirit gel and we mixed it with water, half-and-half. "You don't need to drink a lot of it to get drunk. "I've lost a few of my friends, the ones who drank Ace cider and hand wash gel. The fatalities of at least three individuals in London have been attributed by coroners to the use of alcohol hand sanitizer since 2008. Two were poisoned while one drowned in a canal in Paddington after visiting St Mary's Hospital. And a BBC London Freedom of Information request found cases reported at Barts Health NHS Trust, London North West Healthcare NHS Trust, St George's Hospital, Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals, Homerton Hospital, the Royal Free Hospital and Guy's and St Thomas Hospital. Guy's and St Thomas saw the most cases, with 29 reports of hand wash theft in the past three years. A spokeswoman for the hospital said hand wash was vital to maintain hygiene, but staff were told to remain vigilant about people drinking it and to report anything suspicious. However, incident logs obtained by the BBC made clear the problems caused on London's hospital wards by those swallowing the substance. â€¢ At the Royal Free Hospital a patient was found unconscious in his bed with alcohol gel by the bedside and another container in his bag. Emergency care had to be given. â€¢ At St George's Hospital a patient was found drinking the gel in bed. According to the medical report he was constantly trying to get up, and then tripped and fell. The log described the subsequent action taken as: "Patient put back to bed. " â€¢ At the Royal London Hospital a member of staff was assaulted by someone stealing hand gel. Security or police have been called by the trust on four occasions over the issue. Janice Stevens, interim chief nurse at the Royal London, said: "A nurse was assaulted when a member of the public was trying to take alcohol gel, which they were going to consume. "Security was immediately called, the person was removed and the nurse was supported following the assault. " She continued: "The alcohol gel is locked and we've removed alcohol gel from the non-clinical areas such as outpatients, which is lower in risk of infection. "Staff are aware of the importance of keeping an eye on the gel and we are just piloting an alcohol-free gel to see whether that has the same impact on the bugs. It's there to prevent infections such as MRSA. " Dr Sarah Jarvis, a leading GP, warned: "These alcohol gels are not made to be drunk. Therefore they will have all sorts of things added to them which will be very toxic. "They can cause severe inflammation on the inside of your gut. "This is going to be a particular problem for alcoholics because they tend to have inflammation on the stomach and they can have swollen veins inside their stomach, so they are much more prone to bleeding. " She continued: "You can also get alcohol poisoning, which can be fatal. "There's absolutely no question that these things can kill and there have been several situations where patients have been killed. " Hospitals across London detailed the extra precautions they were taking, which included installing lockable dispensers. In other cases a foam was used rather than a gel, hand wash was removed from some public areas and non-alcoholic wash or gel with a thicker consistency trialled. An NHS England spokeswoman said: "In the interests of patient safety, hospitals take a vigilant approach to preventing infection. "Hospitals have alcohol hand wash to protect patients, the public and NHS staff, and to support high standards of cleanliness. "We would condemn any gangs or individuals targeting hand gel for their own purposes which could put patients' health wellbeing at risk. " The Metropolitan Police and the Department for Health made no comment.
Ian Stewart, 56, denies murdering Helen Bailey at their home in Royston, Hertfordshire, in April. Her body was found in July, dumped in a cesspit under the garage. St Albans Crown Court heard Mr Stewart told a psychiatric nurse he had thought about taking his own life. Follow updates on this story and other Hertfordshire news The nurse Sarah Tooley told the jury she had spoken with Mr Stewart on the phone in May. He had been to visit Broadstairs in Kent where Ms Bailey had a holiday cottage. "He had considered the idea of leaping from a cliff while he was in that area," Ms Tooley stated. Earlier, it was revealed in court that Mr Stewart had attempted to steer a police search away from the garage. According to a statement from Det Con Hollie Daines, read to the court, Mr Stewart said: "If searches are going to take place, you wouldn't find anything in the garage. " When they arrived, DC Daines said Mr Stewart told her he had considered suicide. She said: "He appeared to be anxious and uncomfortable with what we were asking of him. On the day Ms Bailey went missing, Mr Stewart stated that he discovered a note from the writer of Electra Brown indicating she had gone to the holiday cottage in Broadstairs. In a statement presented in court, he informed the police: "If Helen returns, I do not believe I want to continue being with her." " Mr Stewart, of Baldock Road, Royston, Hertfordshire, denies charges of murder, preventing a lawful burial, fraud and three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.
Holyrood's health committee said measures such as restricting cars in towns and increasing parking charges would be politically unpopular. But they said the policies could also encourage people to be more active. Almost two thirds (65%) of adults in Scotland were overweight in 2015, including 29% who were obese. Meanwhile, 28% of children were at risk of becoming overweight, with 15% at risk of obesity. Committee members also urged the Scottish government to consider whether regulations could be brought in which would prevent retailers promoting foods that are bad for health. The committee is currently considering if it could bring forward its own legislative proposals to tackle the problem. In a letter to Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell, the committee said: "We support a bold approach to the new obesity strategy and would encourage you to include options that may initially be unpopular as this could result in an important step towards balancing out health inequalities in Scotland. " The committee highlighted the "obesogenic environment in Scotland", where unhealthy food is "more available and more heavily promoted than in other countries". Two fifths of adults do not do enough exercise to meet guidelines, it added, with MSPs also pointing to a food culture of people eating together less, and snacking more. And it said poverty forces some shoppers to opt for high calorie choices instead of healthier options. While the MSPs said "good policies" had been brought in to tackle the obesity problem, they added they were "not necessarily translating into healthy outcomes". They said: "The main reason given for this was an inconsistent approach to resourcing the policies and frameworks. This resulted in successful policies not being scaled up or stopped altogether. " Ms Campbell was pressed on whether the government would restore its funding for the Jogscotland initiative, which the committee said had been "particularly successful in encouraging women to undertake more physical activity". The committee also recommended that funds may have to be set aside to finance initiatives once a fresh strategy to tackle obesity is implemented. The MSPs expressed: "We acknowledge that interventions come with a cost but we are of the opinion that the Scottish government needs to seriously consider investing in preventative measures." "The initial outlay would seem to be outweighed by the ultimate cost savings to the NHS, employers, and local authorities. "All the above show there is no easy fix for tackling obesity in Scotland and a comprehensive long term, cross-portfolio approach will be required. " Committee convenor Neil Findlay said it was disappointing that the "good policies" put in place to tackle obesity by the Scottish government "don't seem to be working". The Labour MSP added: "Scotland has not previously been afraid to take the initiative to tackle health related issues when other interventions have failed. This is why this committee is asking for a bold approach to tackling obesity. "If we don't act now, we will be condemning future generations to a lifetime of poor health which is often driven by poverty leading to poor dietary choices. " Responding to the committee's letter, Ms Campbell said: "We have consistently called on the UK government to ban junk food advertising before the 9pm watershed. "And we are looking at what further effective actions we can take within the powers available to us, including the use of multi-buy promotions, as well as examining a range of actions to improve diet, physical activity and education. "We have announced our intention to set out and consult on the development of our new diet and obesity strategy this year, building on our wide range of activity to make it easier for people - including children and their families - to be more active, eat less, and eat better. " Obesity Action Scotland supported the committee's conclusions on tackling price promotions of unhealthy food. Programme lead Lorraine Tulloch said: "We know that price promotions lead us to buy more than we intended and consume more than we intended. "We need to ensure that the healthy choice is the easy choice for everyone. " It was also backed by consumer group Which? Its director of campaigns and communications, Vickie Sherriff, said: "Our research has shown that people in Scotland would like to eat more healthily but it's the less healthy options that are more likely to be included in supermarket promotions. "Retailers have to be more responsible with the type of products they include in their offers. "To help tackle the obesity crisis the Scottish government has to do more to ensure food manufacturers and retailers make their promotions more responsible and commit to targets to reduce their sugar, salt and saturated fat levels.

She accelerates to 86mph and frequently has no visibility from one thrilling curve to the next on the track. It is chilly, tough, speedy, and unquestionably risky, and Laura Deas is acutely aware of the dangers of skeleton racing. And this week the 27-year-old from Wrexham competes at the World Championships with a single aim - to win a medal. How do you even get into a sport that sees you reaching above legal motorway speeds on a small sled the size of a seat cushion? "I got into it through a UK sport talent project. I was spotted at a talent selection day and asked to go to for training," Deas explains. "Eight of us were then selected to have the chance to go out to Lillehammer in Norway and have a go on the ice. "The idea was to see if any of us were brave enough to do it properly! "We went to the Olympic track, but didn't go from the top first time. "We started from an entry ramp about half way down and picked up speed coming down. But it was still pretty scary the first time we did it. "It is scary - it is a scary sport and you do know that at any time, you could crash. " Deas can think of no better comparison. "I liken it to riding a rollercoaster. If you ride a rollercoaster three times a day for a year, eventually, the fear diminishes and you begin to pay attention to the specifics and aim to get to the bottom swiftly," she says. "That's what it is like doing the skeleton. Over time, you stop thinking about the bad things and what could go wrong. "The quickest speed I've ever done is 86mph, but some of the men get to over 90mph on certain tracks. "You can see what is coming up sometimes, you're normally looking 10 or 15 feet in front of you. "All the manipulations of the sled should be subtle. If you can see what we are doing, the sled probably isn't where you want it to be. " Deas says she is unfazed by the challenge of extending an illustrious line of British women's success at the World Championships in Igls, Austria. She took over as British number one following Lizzy Yarnold's decision to take a sabbatical from this season's World Cup circuit and is currently ranked fourth in the world. Deas' four predecessors - Yarnold, Amy Williams, Shelley Rudman and Alex Coomber - all won Olympic medals while Yarnold and Rudman both also claimed the World Championship crown. "There is a certain amount of expectation that comes with earning a place on the British women's World Cup squad, but it is no different to the pressure I put on myself," Deas explained. "I'd like to think I've established myself in that group of athletes who have the expectation of being in medal contention every time they race, and having been on top of the podium it just makes me want to win even more. "I want to be on top of the podium and in that sense it makes no difference what anybody else has done - but it gives me confidence to know so many have gone through the same programme and succeeded. ".
Left-arm pace bowler Little, 16, and wicketkeeper-batsman Tucker, 19, impressed at the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh this year and are among six new faces for the Bready matches. Greg Thompson, James Shannon, Sean Terry and David Rankin are recalled. The matches are part of two double-headers with Ireland women facing Bangladesh in morning matches. The men's matches will be held at Bready on 5 and 6 September, commencing at 15:30 BST. Additionally, Ireland women will face Bangladesh in ODIs at the same location on 8 and 10 September - with all games starting at 10:30. "We wanted to bring some freshness to the squad - in particular we are delighted to see the youth of Josh Little and Lorcan Tucker added to the squad," said chair of selectors Alan Lewis. Left-arm fast bowlers have been very effective in T20 matches and we are optimistic that Josh's debut will propel his career. He delivers the ball quickly and is a superb athlete. Lorcan's capacity to score from all parts of the field with his versatile game, as demonstrated at the U19 World Cup, along with his skills as a wicketkeeper, provides the team with excellent balance.

Robbie Morrison was knifed in the leg in Edinburgh's Wester Hailes area on 22 August last year and died in hospital. Kristian Nelson, who was originally accused of murdering Mr Morrison, pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of culpable homicide. Nelson's co-accused Colin Craig had his guilty plea to assault accepted. The court was informed that Craig caused Mr Morrison to stumble and fall to the ground, when Mr Morrison attempted to flee following an argument with Nelson. Shortly thereafter, Nelson utilized a knife to puncture Mr Morrison in the back of his left thigh, resulting in a 15cm (6in) wound. The victim got away from the scene of the attack with blood "splashing" from his leg, the court was told. The trail of blood from Mr Morrison's leg led the police to Dumbryden Gardens where Nelson lived. Mr Morrison stopped breathing on the way to hospital and was given resuscitation treatment. He underwent surgery but his condition deteriorated and he died in the early hours of 25 August. Unemployed Nelson, 37, who has previous convictions for assault, later admitted stabbing the victim but said: "I didn't mean to kill him. " His defence solicitor advocate David Allan told the High Court in Edinburgh: "It is clear a significant prison sentence is inevitable in relation to this crime. " Advocate depute Steven Borthwick, prosecuting, told the court that Mr Morrison, who had a young daughter, left the Army in 2011 after six years' service. He said that following his military service he became involved in substance misuse and it was believed be bought drugs in the Wester Hailes area, but at the time of his death was seeking help for his problem. The prosecutor stated that the level of familiarity between the accused and the deceased is not completely understood. The reason behind the assault that resulted in Robbie Morrison's death remains unknown. " He added: "There is some information to suggest that the now deceased owed a debt to a third party and the confrontation between Robbie Morrison and the accused arose as a result of that debt. " Mr Borthwick said the Crown was unable to give a reliable and undisputed version of events.
Victoria from Aalborg Zoo in Denmark has her own enclosure at the Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig. Two male bears - Walker and Arktos - already share an enclosure at the park. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland hopes Victoria will eventually mate with the eldest male, Arktos, or a bear brought in from another zoo. Polar bear cubs were last born in the UK in 1992. Victoria, who was born in 1996 at Rostock Zoo in Germany, is currently the only female polar bear in the UK. She previously raised cubs in 2008. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said: "We are delighted to welcome a female polar bear to the Highlands. Victoria will need to settle in, but visitors should be able to meet our new arrival in a couple of weeks. "Her enclosure is completely separate to Walker and Arktos', as male and female polar bears live separately in the wild. "During the polar bear breeding season, which generally falls between March and May, we will gradually introduce her to Arktos and the two will stay together until the two hopefully mate, when the male will be returned to the bachelor enclosure. " However, RZSS said a male from another site could be brought in "if the breeding programme recommends it". Troops from the British Army's 71 Engineer Regiment and a visiting contingent from the South Dakota National Guard built Victoria's enclosure last year. Mr Richardson said: "A great deal of thought and planning has gone into developing Victoria's enclosure. "It is a large area featuring a large pond and plenty of natural ground for her to explore. In addition to the main enclosure, there is an adjacent smaller holding enclosure with its own pool that will initially house the male until the signs are right for the introduction. "This extra enclosure allows us to also use a visiting male from another zoo, should the breeding programme recommend it, and we are not aware of any other polar bear breeding facility that has this degree of flexibility. " Walker and Arktos have shared an enclosure for three years. Arktos, who is a year older than Walker, arrived at the park from a zoo in Hannover, Germany. Walker has been at the site since November 2010, after being introduced from a Dutch zoo. He was one of two cubs at the centre of a controversy over the BBC's Frozen Planet in 2011. An episode of the documentary series featured the cubs in a den with their mother, with many people assuming they were born and filmed in the Arctic. But the cubs were actually in the zoo in Holland, as revealed in behind-the-scenes footage on the show's website. The BBC stood by the footage and refuted claims of deceiving viewers. At one point, Walker cohabitated in the enclosure at the Highland Wildlife Park with Mercedes, a female bear that had been transferred from Edinburgh Zoo. The 30-year-old bear died in April 2011. She had been suffering severe arthritis which was treated with painkillers. RZSS had thought about matching Walker with a partner in 2011, but that idea was postponed after concerns that she was already expecting a cub. The bear and his mother, Huggies, were both named after a brand of children's diapers.
Wilfred Isaacs Sr, 50, died and his son, Wilfie Isaacs Jr, was injured at Chubbards Cross caravan park, near Ilminster, Somerset, on 5 May. Charlie Broadway, 24, was jailed for 34 years at Bristol Crown Court after being found guilty of murder. John Broadway, 38, was jailed for 15 years and William Broadway, 18, for 12 years, for Mr Isaacs Sr's manslaughter. During the court case, it was revealed that Charlie Broadway shot his neighbour Mr Isaacs Snr with his double-barrelled pump-action shotgun from a short distance, following a feud between the two traveller families. Testimony in court indicated that a dispute had occurred, resulting in John Broadway instructing his younger brother William to retrieve a gun. He then passed the weapon to Charlie who shot Mr Isaacs Sr in front of the victim's partner, two sons and young granddaughter. Charlie Broadway was also convicted of the attempted murder of Mr Isaacs Jr. Detective Inspector Lorna Dallimore, from Avon and Somerset Police, expressed: "Unfortunately, a verbal disagreement between individuals from the two families led to the devastating shooting of two men. " "Our inquiry revealed that Charlie Broadway employed a shortened shotgun to cause fatal wounds to Wilfred Senior and inflict severe injuries on his son. " It was a tragic deed that has ultimately devastated the lives of two families. The family of Mr Isaacs Snr said: "We miss Wilf more than words can express and his humour, love, happiness will never be replaced. " " Three other people were also convicted of offences following the trial. Bonnie Wilson, 30, was sentenced to 18 months in prison suspended for two years after being found guilty of assisting an offender. Charlie Broadway's brothers-in-law Joseph Finney, 33 and Riley Joe Jones, 21, were convicted of unlawful wounding and ABH and were both sentenced to 15 months suspended for two years.
Mrs Merkel said she knew the topic may be difficult following Donald Trump's decision to pull the US out the accord. However, she said, tackling climate change remained a priority for Europe. She was backed by other European leaders who said they would speak with "one voice" in Hamburg. The summit of the world's largest economies takes place next week. As host, it is up to Mrs Merkel to set out the priorities of the annual meeting. This year, the Paris climate agreement, established to limit the impact of carbon emissions on the environment, with countries committed to keeping the rise in global temperatures "well below" 2C, will be among them. Mrs Merkel laid out her views in a speech to the German parliament on Thursday, hours before a meeting of her fellow European leaders. "The differences are obvious and it would be dishonest to try to cover that up. That I won't do," she said. "The European Union unconditionally stands by its agreement in Paris and will implement it speedily and with determination. "More than that: since the decision of the United States to leave the Paris climate agreement, we are more determined than ever to make it a success. Mrs Merkel is not the only one who believes that those who believe isolationism or protectionism can solve the world's problems are mistaken. At a news conference which followed the meeting of Europe's leaders, European Council President Donald Tusk said: "We will speak with one voice at the G20 summit". The group had met in Berlin to discuss their priorities - including climate change and people smuggling - ahead of next week, when they will be joined by Mr Trump. However, they made clear they were not trying to isolate Mr Trump, and were hoping it would give them the opportunity to change his mind. French President Emmanuel Macron - who is a staunch opponent of Mr Trump's climate change policies - emphasised that "the relationship [with the US] is a long term relationship". But he said Europe would "clearly reaffirm our very strong commitment to the Paris accords", adding: "I hope that the others can be brought back to their senses. Mr Trump withdrew the US from the agreement on 1 June, stating that the Paris accord was designed to hinder, disadvantage, and make the US poor. He claimed that the agreement would lead to a $3 trillion decline in US GDP and the elimination of 6 million jobs. 5 million jobs, with countries like China and India receiving preferential treatment. Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a "fair" deal for the US. The decision places the US as one of just three countries which has not signed up to the deal. Nicaragua - which felt the agreement did not go far enough to tackle climate change - and Syria are the other two.
